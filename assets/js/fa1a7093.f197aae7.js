First of all, building trust is a continuous\nprocess. Once built, the trust doesn\u2019t last forever, so we need to constantly\nmaintain it.

It\u2019s similar to attending a party during which we are able to focus on a\nsingle conversation in a noisy room. We subconsciously choose the conversation\non which we focus before we join it. The level of engagement in the conversation\ndepends on the level of trust. Rahel also mentioned that our reactions in\neveryday lives when we so to speak function \u201coffline\u201d, aren\u2019t different from our\nreactions when we are \u201conline\u201d.

He started his presentation by\ndescribing a situation that occurred in Epinal, France. 24 patients suffering\nfrom prostate cancer were exposed to an excessive amount of ionizing radiation.\nFive of them died. It turned out that the tragedy occurred because of human\nerror, a badly designed interface of the machine and the lack of instructions in\nFrench. The content should be designed so that it helps users undertake better\ndecisions. Using documentation, people want to learn what our product is for,\nhow to perform certain tasks, and what choices are available. They also want to\nunderstand why they should perform a given task and what are the most important\nparts. That\u2019s why we should show users the easiest way of achieving their goal\nand describe the remaining options in a place where they will be able to find\nthem easily. Ray drew our attention to the fact that the main communication\nchannel between the customers and the company is the company\u2019s product because\nthe customers spend the majority of time with it. Users are irritated when they\nwaste their time. That\u2019s why the content that is displayed on the user interface\nof our product must be well-designed as it translates directly into user\nexperience. Customers don\u2019t care about silos. They communicate with a company,\nnot with its separate departments. Thus, we have to create integrated\ncommunities inside and outside of the company. We have to listen to what our\ncustomers have to say. We won\u2019t always hear what we\u2019d like to, we don\u2019t always\nhave to accept all remarks, but our duty is to listen to the users. Such\ncommunities need animation that stimulates rather than moderation that\nsuppresses. How can we incorporate user opinions into the product? The\ntraditional model assumes that we have a company on the one side and the user on\nthe other side. Technical communication that later on influences the product is\nin the middle. In a modern approach, the company and users are a single\ncommunity in which the users communicate with the company through the product\nand have a real influence on its shape. By including users in the decisions\nabout the product, we build their loyalty. We should thank them every time they\nhelp us."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://techwriter.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SoapRayGallon.png"},(0,o.kt)("img",{alt:"SoapRayGallon",src:n(80836).Z,width:"569",height:"69"}))),(0,o.kt)("h2",{id:"the-author-is-also-human"},"The Author Is Also Human"),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Information is a two-way road and thus we can\u2019t focus only on the end user.

It makes users feel at loss. Poorly organized\nsystems are frustrating, frustrated users can\u2019t focus and thus make more\nmistakes. That\u2019s why we should remember about consistency and content reuse. The\nsame message should be delivered through all communication channels in the same\nway. Our content should adjust to each channel. We can\u2019t punish the user for\nusing one platform instead of another, for example a mobile phone, for accessing\nour content. The systems should be holistic, all components should communicate\nwith one another. A good example is ",(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://www.amazon.com/"},"Amazon")," whose\nwarehouse system is linked with the website that is used for ordering the goods.\nWe must remember that content management isn\u2019t about technology but about\nbusiness.

Of course, it depends on a number of factors, however the general trend of\ninformation retention is clearly visible. After three days, we remember only 10%\nof the text. However, when it\u2019s supported with images, the amount of remembered\ninformation increases to 65%. That\u2019s why substituting a part of the\ndocumentation with infographics is worth consideration. An infographic consists\nof data visualizations (e.g. charts), images, and text. It\u2019s important for the\nimages to be closely related to the topic because only then they reinforce the\nmessage and cause the users to pay more attention to the content of the\ninfographic. Agnieszka presented how an infographic should be built. It turns\nout that, just like the old good essay, it should have an introduction, a body,\nand an ending. The introduction should draw the attention of the user and\npresent the topic of the infographic. In the body, we go to the heart of the\nmatter by using a combination of text, images, and data visualizations. In the\nend, we provide a summary of the presented information. Agnieszka gave us a\ncouple of tips about creating infographics. One infographic should focus on one\nbig story rather than a couple of small stories. It should be clear and contain\nonly data that is important. We need to remember about limiting the amount of\ntext to minimum and focus mainly on visualizations. Accuracy of our infographic\nis also important. Visualizations must match the numbers and the text. We should\nquote the sources of the information and inform users if the infographics might\nget outdated. Each inaccuracy in the infographic makes it lose its credibility.\nThe speaker also gave pros and cons of creating infographics. First of all,\ninfographics are faster to read and remember, plus creating them is fun.\nHowever, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that not all documents can be changed into\ninfographics. What\u2019s more, infographics might not be treated seriously. Creating\ninfographics is also time consuming, requires additional software and a good\npublication place. At the end of her presentation, Agnieszka showed a couple of\nexamples demonstrating how infographics can be used to limit the amount of\ndocumentation. One of the examples was an infographic that showed a 7-step\ninstallation procedure. The same process was described in the related\ndocumentation in 329 words. Another example was a color-coded infographic about\nthe product infrastructure.

Easy access to information, user assistance integrated with the\nproduct, consistency of the information cause that users perceive the company as\na whole, not a sum of its departments. Good content management strategy is\nneeded also because the world is switching to a multi-channel distribution mode.\nThe channels are pieces of a puzzle. The users use many channels (Twitter,\nFacebook, YouTube) in many formats (computer, tablet, mobile phone) in different\nways.
