Pora na kolejny, już 21 odcinek, cyklu _Kilka pytań do_.

<!--truncate-->

Naszym gościem jest dziś Abigail Sutherland, Information Architect z działu NAV
w firmie TomTom. Urodziła się w Stanach Zjednoczonych, mieszkała przez 15 lat w
Szkocji, obecnie przebywa w Holandii. W ramach swojej roli w TomTomie uczy
nowego podejścia do dokumentowania. Dzięki jej staraniom kolejne osoby angażują
się w sprawy dotyczące dokumentacji. Spędziła sporo czasu w łódzkim biurze
TomToma, ale wciąż po polsku nie potrafi powiedzieć wiele więcej niż "tak",
"nie", "dzień dobry" i oczywiście "dziękuję".

Zapraszamy!

##### How long have you been working as an Information Architect?

I’ve been in this role for a little over four years. But I’ve been writing for
work on the side for much longer. Whenever anyone’s needed something polished,
or been unable to express themselves clearly in a crucial document, they’ve come
to me.

##### How did you become an Information Architect?

It wasn’t a normal way of getting the job. But TomTom is not always a normal
company.

What happened was that I saw that documentation was a big problem in my
organizational unit. Our company culture encourages people to speak up when they
see a problem, and when possible to find ways to solve it. So I spoke up, and
helped when I could (I did have a different job to do after all).

After a while, the leadership team in my department decided to create the role
of Information Architect. Or, more properly, they decided to create a role with
the _title_ of Information Architect. They didn’t really know how to describe
the problem, much less solve it. So my first task was to try to understand what
the problems were, even as I started solving them.

I didn’t have a job description for almost two years. Then I wrote my own.

##### Can you say something about the company you work for and your team?

TomTom is a tech company. We make software and maps for navigation applications,
mostly to run in cars. It’s a rarity in that it’s a European-owned tech company.
Although it’s been around since the last century, it still has a very start-up
mindset, encouraging people to take responsibility and start their own
initiatives when they see a gap. The result of that is that it’s also a very
fractal organization…quite often you find the same things being done or started
up in different areas as people see similar problems and try out their own ways
to solve them.

The writing world within TomTom is certainly like that. We have little clusters
of people throughout the organization that do various forms of writing, from map
specifications to documentation to strings inside applications. We’re starting
to get into better contact with one another in a Documentation Guild.

As for me, strictly speaking, I don’t have a team. There are no other technical
writers in my organizational unit. But I knew this was going to happen – there
wasn’t budget to hire a team of tech writers. So I started teaching my
colleagues how to write.

You could say that I don’t have a team, but considering how TomTom works, how
the Documentation Guild is growing, and how many people in my organizational
unit have learned to be writers at one level or another…I have a _community_.

##### How is your work organized?

I organize my work myself. It falls roughly into three streams:

- **Reviewing and polishing technical writing done by my colleagues.** Mostly
  this takes the form of pull request reviews, because we do a lot of docs as
  code (I’ll talk about this below), but it can also be things emailed to me.
  These are generally small jobs, half an hour or so per piece. I try to keep
  turnaround times very short so that I’m not a bottleneck on processes, partly
  because if I make things harder, people will not involve me.
- **Requested projects.** Teams will ask me to write things or to organize
  information. (The Information Architect role is about deciding how and where
  things are stored, and the processes we use for producing documentation, as
  well as technical writing itself.) These tend to last a few weeks, sometimes
  taking all of the time I’m not using in reviewing and polishing, sometimes
  taking a few hours a week at most. My goal there is to create sustainable
  things – documents that teams can keep up to date themselves, processes and
  tools that the teams own and understand.
- **Long-term initiatives.** My role is more than just fire-fighting. I’m trying
  to put systems and processes in place that make writing easier and better. I
  always have a couple of projects that I’m doing on the side to achieve that.
  These are things I choose and prioritize myself. At the moment I’m doing the
  last stages of cleaning up our enormous and chaotic Confluence space and
  adapting the writing teaching that I used to do in person to online
  instruction.

##### What tools do you use and what do you think about them?

Because a lot of my work is about getting others to write, the tools I use have
to be ones that they can use as well. This excludes both specialist technical
writing protocols such as DITA and software with a high per-seat license cost.

We use a docs as code approach, which means that as much as possible, we use the
same processes to create and change documentation that we do to create and
change software. We keep a lot of our documentation in the repository and update
it with pull requests. This means we’re using a workflow that the teams already
understand, and that is already tooled up and maintained.

To do this, we keep our documentation in a markup language – AsciiDoc. One of my
first initiatives as an Information Architect was the selection exercise that
ended up with it. AsciiDoc can render documentation into a variety of formats,
including HTML and PDF. (It can even create Word documents if you’re willing to
hack a little.) I really like AsciiDoc, because it is both simple enough to work
with very directly and subtle enough to produce good outputs automatically.

The other thing I work with a lot is Confluence, which is our internal Wiki in
TomTom. It’s not a documentation format like AsciiDoc, but rather a publication
platform. It’s very feature-poor…simple, but in a bad way. The search
functionality is frustrating and hard to use well, and you often have to choose
between doing things _easily_ and doing them _well_. That’s very painful.

##### How do you get the information you need to prepare/create documentation?

Since most of our documentation is written by the subject matter experts
themselves, I don’t need to do a lot of interrogation…excuse me, I mean
interviewing for that.

When I do need to get information for something I’m writing, I usually set up a
half-hour or hour meeting with the person, record it, and use very open
questions. I focus on understanding the background and key concepts before
jumping into the specifics. I keep the meeting light and friendly. Then when
I’ve written up what I’ve learned I send it to them and ask for comments.
There’s usually another half-hour meeting somewhere in there for clarifications
that go faster in person.

##### What documents do you deliver, in what form, in which language/languages and how are they published?

- The main documents that I deliver, or contribute to the delivery of, are:
- Product documentation in PDF form that is supplied alongside our software
  development kits (SDKs).
- Product documentation in HTML form for the online APIs on our Developer
  Portal.
- Microcopy (strings) for our apps, which appears in the apps themselves.
- Process documentation for how we work, which is published on Confluence.
- Educational materials such as slides, which I am currently migrating to a new
  platform (see below).

All of these are in English.

##### Do you participate in any other activities besides documentation writing (e.g. creation of marketing materials)? If yes, what is it and what tools do you use?

I’ve mentioned it above, but there are two that I’d like to explain in more
detail.

- I write strings for our apps. This is done in Confluence, which is probably
  the worst tool imaginable for the job, but it’s the one everyone in the
  process has access to. This kind of writing – microcopy – is fascinating,
  because it’s like poetry. Every single word carries a lot of weight, and has
  to both give the user the right high-level information and teach/reinforce the
  underlying mental models that they need to use the app easily. Oh, and it also
  has to convey the right kind of friendly tone, and it has to be able to be
  translated into lots of different languages! It’s a huge challenge.
- The other thing I do that’s pretty far off of standard technical writing work
  is teaching writing. Most of the people in TomTom are not native speakers of
  English, but that is our language of communication. So I teach the basics of
  technical writing. I was doing it in person to groups of people, using a
  PowerPoint slide deck, but the world has changed. So now I’m creating
  materials to use online – either slide decks or online exercises, to cater for
  different learning styles. I’m doing it in AsciiDoc, because there’s a way to
  create presentations with it (using reveal-js), but I can _also_ use the same
  material in webpages. And I’m keeping it all in a repository, so I don’t have
  to worry about versioning.

##### What are the biggest challenges at your work?

To be honest, the biggest challenge is the amount that I have to manage my own
work. That requires a lot of confidence that I’m making the right choices, and
that the work I’m doing is any good. Without a team around me, that all has to
come from me.

Most of the time, I trust my instincts, and those instincts are generally good
(or good enough, anyway.) But it’s definitely the hardest part of my job.

##### What do you like the most in technical writing?

The feeling when I take someone else’s writing where the _content_ is good but
the expression is not clear, and turn it into simple, understandable writing.

##### What is your advice for those who want to begin their adventure with writing documentation?

I’m a terrible person to ask this of, because my path into technical writing was
so strange. But the one thing you really need to do to be a good technical
writer is be a good writer. So write! Write in your native language, write in
English. Read good writing, and ask yourself what makes it good.

##### What does the labor market look like for Tech Writers in the Netherlands? Are there any organizations that unite Technical Writers in the Netherlands?

I won’t be able to give good answers about tech writing in the Netherlands. I
didn’t come to this by the straight path. But the place to go for these kinds of
questions is the
[Write The Docs community](https://www.writethedocs.org/slack/), which is
worldwide and very, very friendly. I recommend them unconditionally. WTD is the
place to go. They do an annual salary survey, there’s a channel for tech writing
jobs, and there are tons of people who can answer questions about getting into
the business.

##### Do you have any diploma or certificate in technical writing? If yes, did it help you in your career?

No…I have a bachelor’s degree in classical Latin and a postgraduate certificate
in software technology. But I grew up in a household that spoke highly educated
English (both of my parents were lawyers). And I’ve been writing in various
ways, online and offline, throughout my life.

##### Do you have an idea about how the technical writer role is going to evolve in the near future? Where is it headed, and what are the biggest trends on the horizon?

I think that the trend of having subject matter experts write the first draft of
some documents is going to continue, and we need to work with that. Docs as Code
is here to stay, not just because it uses well-understood workflows but because
it’s flexible and portable.

But the most interesting thing on the horizon is video. So many teenagers and
young adults just entering the workforce prefer to get their content in video
form. At the moment, we don’t have good tools for creating and managing video
content, though one side-effect of the pandemic is that more people are getting
good at working with their webcams. Note that this doesn’t replace written
content – some people still prefer to read. It’s that we need to cater for a
wider range of ways of getting information.

##### Thank you for your insights.
