**Technical Writer - Kraków Development Centre, Poland**

We're looking for talented and intellectually curious technical writers for our
team. Writers who can apply both intuitive and analytical thinking and quickly
understand complex software. Writers who can visualize the big picture and
brainstorm about edge cases. Writers who are technical enough to experiment with
the product, test assumptions, and even dive into source code to figure out how
something works.

As a technical writer in the Documentation team, you will:

- Work with geographically distributed teams of developers and product managers
  to understand the behavior and nuances of our products.
- Plan, design, and develop content for features/modules and multiple
  deliverables.
- Write documentation for our applications, plugins, and APIs.
- Contribute to content development efforts and to departmental projects and
  initiatives.
- Collaborate extensively with Documentation team members in Ireland and the
  U.S.

To succeed in this role, you must have excellent communication and collaboration
skills, a high technical aptitude, a hands-on approach, and a self-motivated
attitude. Expect to work in a fast-changing, flexible environment, and to use
your own judgment extensively.

**Required skills and experience**

- 3+ years of experience writing documentation for enterprise software products
- Excellent writing and communication skills
- Familiarity with HTML, CSS, XML, and related web technologies
- Knowledge of web applications, databases, and object-oriented-programming
- Knowledge of standard industry practices in information development and
  delivery
- Good understanding of topic-based authoring, XML, DITA, and content delivery
  processes
- Proficiency with authoring tools such as Adobe FrameMaker and Oxygen XML
  Author
- Ability to meet aggressive deadlines and prioritize multiple tasks
- Ability to elicit information from experts and learn by experimenting
- BA/BS in Technical Writing, English, Computer Science, or related degree or
  comparable experience.

Preferably, candidates also have some of the following:

- Ability to write code to test assumptions or for short documentation examples
- Experience creating and delivering content for SaaS applications, including
  embedded assistance and online help
- Experience working with cross-geo teams
- Experience in an Agile environment

**About the Documentation team**

The Documentation team creates and publishes content that helps our users
understand technical and business concepts and successfully deploy and customize
Guidewire products.

Our audience includes business analysts, technical consultants, and various
levels of programmers. Writers must deeply understand the end-to-end behavior of
our product features and functionality as well as related configuration files
and APIs. We regularly install product builds, dive into the code, and often
figure out documentation needs even before we get any developer documentation.

Our custom production, validation, and automation tools enable writers to focus
on learning complex information and writing about it, rather than on production
work or investigating documentation build problems.

**About Guidewire**

ultra-competent colleagues, and plenty of freedom to innovate and create. We

are critical to the company and its customers.
