Z nieukrywaną przyjemnością publikujemy kolejny gościnny wpis od sympatyka
naszego portalu.

<!--truncate-->

Jack natrafił na naszą stronę szukając informacji na temat pisania. Los (albo
może bardziej Google) zdecydował, że znalazł on jeden z naszych
[wpisów](http://techwriter.pl/less-is-more-strikes-again/), w którym
wspominaliśmy o
[infografice](http://writing.rocks/how-to-write-a-sentence-infographic/) "How to
write a sentence". Infografika bardzo przypadła mu do gustu, więc postanowił do
nas napisać. A że ogólnie lubi pisać, bardzo szybko dał się namówić na gościnny
wpis pt. "Free Online Grammar Check Tools \[to Improve Your Writing\]".

# Kilka słów o autorze

materiałów edukacyjnych oraz informacji na temat zdobywania wiedzy. Jednym z
elementów portalu jest blog poruszający tematy takie jak uczenie się, techniki
czytania i pisania oraz produktywność. Jack już na studiach rozpoczął swoją
karierę jako niezależny pisarz i wciąż podąża tą samą ścieżką. W swojej pracy
lubi najbardziej to, że może ją łączyć z podróżowaniem po świecie.

# Podziękowanie od techwriter.pl

Dziękujemy Jackowi za ten artykuł. Nam najbardziej przypadły do gustu oczywiście
narzędzia, które wspierają język polski, czyli Language Tool i Sentence Checker.
W zestawieniu na pierwszym miejscu znalazło się narzędzie Grammarly, o którym
[pisaliśmy jakiś czas temu](http://techwriter.pl/grammarly-narzedzie-do-sprawdzania-pisowni/).
Warto też wymienić Hemingway Editora, o którym nie tak dawno w swoim
[poście](http://idratherbewriting.com/2017/07/27/why-simple-language-isnt-so-simple/)
wspominał też Tom Johnson. To narzędzie nie tylko sprawdza pisownię, ale pomaga
też prościej pisać poprzez oznaczanie w tekście ciężkich do zrozumienia zdań,
strony biernej i niepotrzebnych słów. A które narzędzie wydaje się dla Was
najbardziej odpowiednie? Czekamy na Wasze komentarze.

Jeżeli macie pomysły na artykuły, lub gotowe teksty, dajcie nam znać. Bardzo
chętnie publikujemy treści koleżanek i kolegów po fachu, ponieważ jest to dla
Was świetna okazja, żeby podzielić się ze światem swoją wiedzą, doświadczeniem i
przemyśleniami.
