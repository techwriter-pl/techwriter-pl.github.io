<a href="http://techwriter.pl/soap-2014-relacja-z-pierwszego-dnia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the day 1 summary</a>
that we published some time ago. Enjoy!</p><p>After our general summary, it’s time to get down to the nitty-gritty. Today we
are providing you with a short overview of the presentations that were delivered
during the first day of <a href="http://soapconf.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the soap! 2014 conference</a>.</p><p><a href="http://techwriter.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/DSC6686.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" alt="soap! 2014 audience" src="/assets/images/DSC6686-1024x489-86725ff9c34f7ca129935b9ed859447c.jpg" width="1024" height="489" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="games-not-only-for-kids">Games not only for kids<a href="#games-not-only-for-kids" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Games not only for kids" title="Bezpośredni link do Games not only for kids">​</a></h2><p>The honour of warming up the audience fell to
<a href="http://soapconf.com/speakers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monika Konieczny</a>. She started her presentation
with a story about a cat called Teodor who wanted to help its owner and do the
laundry. For a moment we were wondering where the story was going. The finale
was quite drastic because Teodor almost died buried under a voluminous and
badly-written manual. Monika tried to show how to avoid such tragedies. As we’ve
already heard more than once, manuals are too long, too boring, and
incomprehensible. What’s more, it’s difficult to find a common denominator for
the readers of the manual because each of us pays attention to different
details, and the way we use a particular product often depends on how much
experience we have with it. Additionally, there are problems of linguistic
nuances and a high context culture, like the Polish one. The first step to
solving these issues is creating the user profile and narrowing down the
characteristics of the target audience. You also have to put yourself in the
user’s shoes, try to create potential stress situations to understand how the
user might feel in such moments and what information he or she will need. Monika
also tried to convince us that technical documentation does not have to be
boring. It’s enough to give it characteristics of a novel and write it so that
we would want to read it ourselves. Everyone wants to feel like a superhero.
According to Monika, we should use this fact to our advantage and create
documentation that makes users feel that each thing they learn from that
documentation gives them new superpowers. Apart from the novel aspect, we also
heard about introducing elements of a game into documents, a.k.a. gamification.
The mere addition of ranks and badges is no longer sufficient as the users get
bored quickly. It’s possible to introduce microgames - smaller challenges that
the user can undertake - or exploration of the interface where a particular
action triggers a response from the system and allows for discovering new
functions. Monika’s examples of increasing the attractiveness of documentation
by introducing elements of novels and games included a comic book for Ruby
programmers, <a href="http://www.ribbonhero.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ribbon Hero 2</a> – the great return of
the well-known Clippy from MS Office, and the
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stack Overflow portal</a>.</p><p><a href="http://techwriter.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SoapMonikaKonieczny.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" alt="SoapMonikaKonieczny" src="/assets/images/SoapMonikaKonieczny-617f2c0dca604372009bc4eaef4ddcdf.jpg" width="570" height="57" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="plenty-is-sometimes-a-plague">Plenty is sometimes a plague<a href="#plenty-is-sometimes-a-plague" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Plenty is sometimes a plague" title="Bezpośredni link do Plenty is sometimes a plague">​</a></h2><p>As we were told by <a href="http://soapconf.com/speakers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kasia Mrowca</a>, the same is
the case for a surplus of functions in an application. Clients always want to
add many new functionalities to their app. Before we satisfy their needs, we
should stop for a moment and think where their requirements come from. Sometimes
the problem lies in the process and adding a new option to the interface doesn’t
change anything. It’s the process that needs to be modified. Sometimes new
functions are requested out of habit. Someone has always had one switch or the
other in the previous software and wants to have the same one in the new
application even though it’s completely unnecessary. Kasia mentioned the pareto
rule according to which 80% of users use only 20% of functions, Microsoft Word
can be an example here. Each new function makes the application more complex. It
translates into its usability and the level of complexity of the accompanying
documentation. One has to know the limit just like with eating chocolate. After
a certain amount, it’s no longer a pleasure.<br>
<!-- -->So, how do we stay sane? All departments in the company have to cooperate on a
friendly basis. Instead of interfering with one another, let’s exchange ideas.
Let’s not focus only on our field, but keep the common goal in mind at all
times. At the end, a warning from the presentation: never show a model of an
application that is too similar to the final version because the clients will
want to have the application immediately.</p><p><a href="http://techwriter.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SoapKasiaMrowca.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" alt="SoapKasiaMrowca" src="/assets/images/SoapKasiaMrowca-5af85eae05acb022f3aca9f594a54a91.jpg" width="551" height="114" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="learning-by-entertaining">Learning by entertaining<a href="#learning-by-entertaining" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Learning by entertaining" title="Bezpośredni link do Learning by entertaining">​</a></h2><p>E-learning, like life, is all about choices. Not to waste words,
<a href="http://soapconf.com/speakers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sabina Misiarz-Filipek</a> started her presentation
with a video that was divided into parts. After each part we had to choose what
should happen next thus deciding how the story developed. Unfortunately, we
killed the main hero. However, this wasn’t the most important thing. What really
mattered was that we could learn without feeling bored. Before we start creating
a training we need to specify the target audience and the level of their
computer literacy as it impacts how they will feel during the course. Sabina
referred to, among others,
<a href="http://www.learning-theories.com/kellers-arcs-model-of-motivational-design.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the ARCS didactic model</a>.
The main factor which keeps the users’ attention during the training is their
motivation. It’s also important how relevant to them are the skills that they
are going to gain during the training. We can build user confidence by informing
them how long the training will last, what form it will have, and what hardware
will be required. The level of satisfaction can be increased by adding funny
elements, interesting images and elements of a game. In the past, the strategy
of creating e-learnings assumed a smaller number of long courses. Currently, the
trend is to create a bigger number of shorter courses, games, videos, or
infographics. During the presentation, Sabina provided many interesting
examples. One of them was an introductory course for new employees in the form
of a game. Another example was <a href="https://life-saver.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lifesaver</a> – a game
in the form of a movie that teaches how to make proper choices in emergency
situations that we can encounter in everyday life.</p><p><a href="http://techwriter.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SoapSabinaMisiarzFilipek.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" alt="SoapSabinaMisiarzFilipek" src="/assets/images/SoapSabinaMisiarzFilipek-4f67ddf97034b5cc929ae3d3c2c5f6ec.png" width="570" height="65" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-power-of-the-diagram">The power of the diagram<a href="#the-power-of-the-diagram" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do The power of the diagram" title="Bezpośredni link do The power of the diagram">​</a></h2><p>It has long been known that “a picture is worth a thousand words.” This old
truth was demonstrated by <a href="http://soapconf.com/speakers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kevin Duncan</a>, who
showed how to skilfully use diagrams to make stories we tell more interesting
and concise. One such method is the “whittling wedge”. We start from a wide
range of options, approximately 10, then narrow the choice down to around 3
options. In the end we recommend one of them. Another method is the “bow tie”.
We start our story from a few options, recommend one of them and then move on to
a broader discussion expanding the details. A diagram that shows the
&quot;motivational dip&quot; is also an interesting example. At the beginning, when we
take on something new, we experience a rapid increase in motivation, which lasts
up to a point. Then comes the decline in motivation and the stabilization phase
during which we learn. This phase may end with either success or failure. In
order to streamline our activities we can use the “priority matrix”. With the
help of four criteria - urgent, not urgent, important and unimportant – we
divide the area into four sections. The first one includes matters which are
urgent and unimportant and can be delegated or performed straightaway. The
second section contains urgent and important matters that we need to address
immediately. The third section covers matters which are not urgent and not
important. They can be ignored. The last section contains issues that are not
urgent but important. They must be considered and planned. During his
presentation, Kevin gave many other examples that came from his book
<a href="http://www.thediagramsbook.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“The Diagrams Book”</a>. In addition to the use of
diagrams, we’ve also learned one more important thing. Using the word s<!-- -->*<!-- -->*<!-- -->t
isn&#x27;t out of place during a presentation 😉</p><p><a href="http://techwriter.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SoapKevinDuncan.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" alt="SoapKevinDuncan" src="/assets/images/SoapKevinDuncan-e6a6fe189e51f5c0e7bcaa4c9f11dfea.jpg" width="555" height="58" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="valuable-experience">Valuable experience<a href="#valuable-experience" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Valuable experience" title="Bezpośredni link do Valuable experience">​</a></h2><p>Unfortunately, the last presentation wasn’t utterly clear, at least for us.
<a href="http://soapconf.com/speakers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rajeev Kumar Tiwari and Rajesh Khurana</a> couldn’t
come to Krakow and so they presented remotely. It considerably affected the
level of understanding the speakers who talked about user experience. They
started with explaining that UX is a very broad term that can’t be defined in a
few words. It&#x27;s a cross-discipline into which companies need to invest to be
able to develop. It isn’t a layer or a component of a product but its integral
part that isn’t limited to a particular technology. Then, the speakers presented
the process of creating user experience and showed how the role of a technical
writer changed in that process.</p><p><a href="http://techwriter.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SoapRajeevRajesh.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" alt="SoapRajeevRajesh" src="/assets/images/SoapRajeevRajesh-56e102871a53aeb7118e2320829e3e29.jpg" width="567" height="61" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><p>Translated: Agnieszka Tkaczyk Proofread: Paweł Kowaluk</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tagi:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/news">news</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/z-kraju">z-kraju</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/konferencje">konferencje</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/spolecznosc">spolecznosc</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/konferencja-astc-nsw-2014">Konferencja ASTC (NSW) 2014</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2014-10-31T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">31 października 2014</time> · <!-- -->2 min aby przeczytać</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/docdeveloper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://github.com/docdeveloper.png" alt="Michał Skowron"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/docdeveloper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Michał Skowron</span></a></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Tym razem coś z innej części globu, a dokładniej z Australii.

dotyczącym konferencji Sarah przedstawia ogólne podsumowanie tego co się działo
oraz opis własnej prezentacji.</p><p>Interesujący zakres tematyczny. Może znajdziecie w tych prezentacjach jakąś
inspirację. Dla nas najciekawsze były prezentacje, które przedstawiały
praktyczne przykłady. Warto spojrzeć na prezentację Garetha Oakesa, który mówił

prezentacji, które podzielone zostały na dwie ścieżki. Każdy mógł wybierać i
przebierać w tematach. Niestety nie byliśmy w stanie uczestniczyć we wszystkich
prezentacjach, dlatego przedstawiamy skrótowo tylko niektóre z nich.
<a href="http://techwriter.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/noz2ndday.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" alt="noz2ndday" src="/assets/images/noz2ndday-835cbd01ef35bb93eb1f83de7c576c01.jpg" width="807" height="534" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="zaufanie-przede-wszystkim">Zaufanie przede wszystkim<a href="#zaufanie-przede-wszystkim" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Zaufanie przede wszystkim" title="Bezpośredni link do Zaufanie przede wszystkim">​</a></h2><p>I to nie tylko w związku. <a href="http://soapconf.com/speakers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rahel Ann Bailie</a>
mówiła o tym jak ważne jest budowanie zaufania użytkowników. Jest to przede
wszystkim proces ciągły. Raz zbudowane zaufanie nie trwa wiecznie, dlatego
musimy cały czas je utrzymywać. Otoczenie generuje więcej bodźców niż jesteśmy w
stanie przetworzyć. Otrzymujemy za dużo treści, dlatego podchodzimy do niej
bardzo selektywnie i wybieramy to na czym chcemy się skupić. Jest to &quot;efekt
spotkania towarzyskiego&quot;
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail_party_effect" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cocktail party effect</a>).
Skupiamy się tylko na wybranym bodźcu, a resztę filtrujemy, przez co stają się
one szumem w tle. Jest to sytuacja podobna do tej w jakiej znajduje się osoba
biorąca udział w spotkaniu towarzyskim, podczas którego jest w stanie skupić się
na pojedynczej rozmowie w gwarnym pomieszczeniu. Taka osoba wybiera sobie
podświadomie rozmowę, na której się skupi zanim do niej dołączy. Poziom
zaangażowania w rozmowę zależy od poziomu zaufania. Rahel wspomniała również o
tym, że nasze reakcje w życiu codziennym, czyli wtedy kiedy funkcjonujemy
&quot;offline&quot; nie różnią się od naszych reakcji podczas funkcjonowania &quot;w sieci&quot;. W
obydwu sytuacjach mamy takie same odczucia dotyczące akceptacji i odrzucenia.
Obecna generacja szuka

Dlatego nie możemy mieć podejścia, że media społecznościowe są po prostu
kolejnym kanałem dostarczania treści, ponieważ przy takim założeniu realizują
komunikację jednostronną, co nie jest w żaden sposób społecznościowe. Potrzebna
jest odpowiedź ze strony użytkowników. Nie chodzi tylko o liczbę polubień i osób
obserwujących dany wpis czy profil. Jest to bardziej skomplikowane, tak samo jak
ludzie. Rahel przytoczyła
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cluetrain_Manifesto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cluetrain Manifesto</a>.
Wrzucanie nowych treści nie jest wystarczające, trzeba rozmawiać z
użytkownikami. Tylko w taki sposób zdobędziemy ich zaufanie.</p><p><a href="http://techwriter.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SoapRahelAnnBailie.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" alt="SoapRahelAnnBailie" src="/assets/images/SoapRahelAnnBailie-b9714ddc2ebf652322a6e30adc5a2b57.png" width="581" height="316" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="źle-napisana-instrukcja-może-zabić">Źle napisana instrukcja może zabić<a href="#źle-napisana-instrukcja-może-zabić" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Źle napisana instrukcja może zabić" title="Bezpośredni link do Źle napisana instrukcja może zabić">​</a></h2><p>Taką drastyczną wizję zaserwował swoim słuchaczom
<a href="http://soapconf.com/speakers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ray Gallon</a>. Swoją prezentację rozpoczął od
przedstawienia sytuacji, jaka miała miejsce we francuskim mieście Epinal. Grupa
24 pacjentów, którzy zostali poddani naświetlaniu promieniowaniem jonizującym z
powodu raka prostaty, otrzymało nadmierną dawkę. W związku z tym 5 z nich
zmarło. Okazało się, że przyczynami tej tragedii były ludzki błąd, słabo
zaprojektowany interfejs maszyny oraz brak instrukcji obsługi w języku
francuskim. Treść powinna być zaprojektowana w taki sposób, żeby pomagać
użytkownikom podejmować lepsze decyzje. Użytkownicy chcą się dowiedzieć z
dokumentacji do czego nasz produkt służy, jak wykonać określone czynności i
jakie mają możliwości wyboru. Chcą też zrozumieć po co muszą wykonać daną
czynność i co jest istotne. Dlatego pokażmy im najprostszą drogę do wykonania
zadania, a pozostałe możliwości opiszmy w takim miejscu, żeby użytkownik mógł je
łatwo znaleźć jeśli będzie tego chciał. Ray zwrócił uwagę na fakt, że tak
naprawdę głównym kanałem komunikacji klientów z firmą jest jej produkt, ponieważ
z nim spędzają najwięcej czasu. Użytkownicy denerwują się kiedy marnują czas,
dlatego treść, która zawarta jest w interfejsie naszego oprogrogramowania musi
być dobrze zaprojektowana, ponieważ to bezpośrednio przekłada się na
doświadczenie użytkownika. Klientów nie interesują silosy. Oni komunikują się z
firmą, a nie z poszczególnymi działami. Dlatego musimy tworzyć zintegrowane
społeczności wewnątrz i na zewnątrz firmy, w których każdy jest udziałowcem.
Słuchajmy tego co mają do powiedzenia użytkownicy. Nie zawsze usłyszymy to co
byśmy chcieli, nie zawsze musimy akceptować ich uwagi, ale naszym obowiązkiem
jest ich wysłuchać. Takie społeczności potrzebują animacji, która stymuluje,
bardziej niż moderacji, która tłumi. W jaki sposób można wcielić opinie
użytkowników w produkt? Tradycyjny model zakłada, że po jednej stronie jest
firma a po drugiej społeczność użytkowników. Pośrodku jest komunikacja
techniczna, która następnie wpływa na produkt. W nowoczesnym podejściu firma i
użytkownicy to jedna społeczność, w której użytkownicy komunikują się z firmą za
pomocą produktu i mają realny wpływ na jego kształt. Włączając użytkowników w
decyzje dotyczące produktu budujemy ich lojalność. Podziękujmy im za każdym
razem kiedy byli pomocni.</p><p><a href="http://techwriter.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SoapRayGallon.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" alt="SoapRayGallon" src="/assets/images/SoapRayGallon-a3c2735209fee04275f0968b9afb007e.png" width="569" height="69" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="autor-też-człowiek">Autor też człowiek<a href="#autor-też-człowiek" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Autor też człowiek" title="Bezpośredni link do Autor też człowiek">​</a></h2><p>Informacja to droga dwukierunkowa, dlatego nie możemy się skupiać wyłącznie na
użytkowniku końcowym. Musimy również pamiętać o autorze i jego doświadczeniu
(author experience, AX) o czym mówił w swojej prezentacji
<a href="http://soapconf.com/speakers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rick Yagodich</a>. Rick starał się pokazać nam
bolączki
<a href="http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_zarz%C4%85dzania_tre%C5%9Bci%C4%85" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">systemów zarządzania treścią (CMS)</a>.
Większość platform CMS nie jest zbudowana po to, żeby łatwiej prowadziło się
biznes, ale po to, żeby oferować super funkcje. Występuje sporo rozbieżności nie
tylko pomiędzy różnymi programami, ale nawet wewnątrz jednego programu.
Terminologia i sposób wykonywania zadań nie są spójne co powoduje, że
użytkownicy są zagubieni. Kiepsko zorganizowane systemy są frustrujące, a
sfrustrowani użytkownicy nie potrafią się dostatecznie skupić i popełniają
więcej błędów. Dlatego powinniśmy pamiętać o spójności i ponownym
wykorzystywaniu treści. Ta sama wiadomość powinna być dostarczana wszystkimi
kanałami komunikacji w taki sam sposób. Nasze treści powinny dostosywać się do
danego kanału. Nie możemy karać użytkownika za to, że używa takiej a nie innej
platformy, np. telefonu komórkowego, do przeglądania dostarczanych przez nas
treści. Systemy powinny być całościowe, wszystkie komponenty powinny się ze sobą
komunikować, tak jak np. w przypadku <a href="http://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazona</a>, gdzie
system do obsługi magazynu współpracuje bezpośrednio ze stroną internetową do
zamawiania towaru. Pamiętajmy, że zarządzanie treścią nie dotyczy technologii,
tylko biznesu, dlatego trzeba ułatwiać ludzki proces zarządzania treścią.</p><p><a href="http://techwriter.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SoapRickYagodich.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" alt="SoapRickYagodich" src="/assets/images/SoapRickYagodich-e53ff52fcea2f92f6d3596973de506ea.png" width="580" height="363" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="zamiast-opowiadać-narysuj">Zamiast opowiadać narysuj<a href="#zamiast-opowiadać-narysuj" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Zamiast opowiadać narysuj" title="Bezpośredni link do Zamiast opowiadać narysuj">​</a></h2><p>A dokładniej przedstaw co masz na myśli za pomocą infografiki.
<a href="http://soapconf.com/speakers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Agnieszka Tkaczyk</a> opowiadała o swojej przygodzie
z tworzeniem infografik.
<a href="http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krzywa_zapominania" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Krzywa zapominania</a> pokazuje,
że po 24 godzinach zapominamy 50% tego co przeczytaliśmy, a po roku praktycznie
wszystko. Oczywiście jest to uzależnione od wielu czynników, natomiast wyraźnie
widać ogólny trend ilości informacji jaką jesteśmy w stanie zachować w pamięci.
Po trzech dniach, pamiętamy tylko 10% tekstu, ale jeśli jest to tekst z
obrazkami, wtedy ta wartość wzrasta do 65%. Dlatego warto pomyśleć o zastąpieniu
części dokumentacji infografiką. Infografika składa się z wizualizacji danych
(np. wykresu) obrazków i tekstu. Ważne jest to, żeby obrazki były jak
najbardziej związane z tematem, bo wtedy wzmacniają przekaz i powodują, że
użytkownik bardziej zwraca uwagę na treść infografiki. Agnieszka przedstawiła
nam jak powinna być zbudowana infografika. Okazuje się, że tak samo jak stara
dobra <a href="http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rozprawka" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rozprawka</a>, o której uczyli nas w
szkole, czyli ze wstępu, rozwinięcia i zakończenia. Wstęp powinien przykuć uwagę
użytkownika i przybliżyć temat infografiki. W rozwinięciu przechodzimy do
meritum za pomocą kombinacji tekstu, obrazków i danych. W zakończeniu
przedstawiamy podsumowanie przedstawionych informacji. Agnieszka przedstawiła
nam kilka wskazówek co do tworzenia infografik. Jedna infografika powinna
przedstawiać jedną większą historię, a nie kilka małych. Ponadto powinna być
jasna, przejrzysta i zawierać dane, które są istotne. Musimy też pamiętać, o
tym, żeby ograniczyć ilość tekstu do minimum i skupić się przede wszystkim na
stronie wizualnej. Bardzo istotna jest też dokładność naszych infografik.
Wizualizacje muszą zgadzać się z tym co przedstawiają liczby i tekst. Powinniśmy
też podawać źródła swoich danych oraz informować odbiorców jeśli przedstawione
dane mogą ulec zmianie. Każda niedokładność w inforgrafice powoduje, że jest ona
mniej wiarygodna. Prowadząca przedstawiła również za i przeciw, które należy
wziąć pod uwagę decydując się na tworzenie infografik. Przede wszystkim szybciej
się je czyta i lepiej zapamiętuje, a do tego ich tworzenie to niezła zabawa. Nie
zmienia to jednak faktu, że nie wszystkie dokumenty można zamienić na
infografikę. Dodatkowo, niektórzy mogą traktować taki sposób przedstawiania
informacji jako niezbyt poważny. Ponadto tworzenie infografik jest czasochłonne,
wymaga dodatkowego oprogramowania oraz odpowiedniej platformy do publikacji. Na
koniec swojej prezentacji Agnieszka przytoczyła kilka przykładów pokazujących
jak można ograniczyć ilość dokumentacji stosująć infografiki. Jeden z przykładów
pokazywał infografikę dotyczącą instalacji, która miała raptem siedem kroków.
Dokument, który opisywał ten sam proces zawierał 329 słów. Innym przykładem była
infografika z kodowaniem kolorami, która przedstawiała infrastrukturę sieci.
Dokument, który opisywał tą infrastrukturę liczył 457 słów.</p><p><a href="http://techwriter.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SoapAgnieszkaTkaczyk.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" alt="SoapAgnieszkaTkaczyk" src="/assets/images/SoapAgnieszkaTkaczyk-2f1862d9734bca11ca8dbfb5d614c66a.png" width="581" height="335" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="znajdź-wspólny-język">Znajdź wspólny język<a href="#znajdź-wspólny-język" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Znajdź wspólny język" title="Bezpośredni link do Znajdź wspólny język">​</a></h2><p>Kadra kierownicza niekoniecznie widzi taką samą wartość w dobrze zaprojektowanej
treści jak osoby, które ją tworzą. <a href="http://soapconf.com/speakers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Noz Urbina</a>
starał się nam pokazać jakich sposobów i argumentów możemy użyć, żeby zmienić
punkt widzenia naszych przełożonych. Spójrzmy z perspektywy kierownika,
zastanówmy się jakie problemy spędzają mu sen z powiek. Rozmawiajmy ze
współpracownikami, zorientujmy się co się dzieje wokół nas. Dzięki temu dowiemy
się jakie problemy może potencjalnie rozwiązać nasza strategia zarządzania
treścią. Pokażmy w jaki sposób strategia zarządzania treścią wpływa na strategię
firmy. Jest to część jej kapitału. Łatwy dostęp do informacji dla użytkownów,
pomoc zintegrowana z produktem, spójność przekazywanych informacji powodują, że
użytkownicy postrzegają firmę jako całość, a nie zbiór poszczególnych działów.
Dobra strategia zarządzania treścią jest potrzebna również dlatego, że świat
przechodzi na dystrybucję wielokanałową. Poszczególne kanały to elementy
układanki. Użytkownicy korzystają z wielu kanałów (np. Twitter, Facebook,
YouTube) w wielu formatach (komputer, tablet, komórka) na różne sposoby. Może to
być korzystanie sekwencyjne, czyli rozpoczynanie czynności na jednym urządzeniu
i kontynuowanie na innym, lub jednoczesne, które z kolei może polegać na
równoczesnym wykonywaniu kilku czynności na kilku urządzeniach albo wykonywaniu
jednej czynności na kilku urządzeniach. Dlatego musimy tworzyć spójną treść,
która jest taka sama bez względu na platformę, z której korzystamy. Prowadzący
wieścił nadejście ery <a href="http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadane" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">metadanych</a>, które
sukcesywnie stają się tak samo ważne jak treść. Stosowanie metadanych jest dość
czasochłonne, ale powoduje, że maszyny lepiej rozumieją treści i dzięki temu
potrafią ją wykorzystywać bardziej efektywnie. Przykładem może być wyszukiwarka
<a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google</a>. Sposób podejścia do wyników zmienił się. Kilka
lat temu wpisując pytanie &quot;O której zamyka się sklep ASDA?&quot; wynikiem
wyszukiwania był link. Obecnie wynikiem wyszukiwania jest konkretna odpowiedź.
Noz poruszył też kwestię nadążania za zmianami. Okazuje się, że strategia gdzie
staramy się nadążyć za trendami to strategia skazana na porażkę. Zamiast tego
powinniśmy wprowadzić strategię przewidywania. Zamiast obserwować konkurencję,
bądźmy wizjonerami. Treść wpływa na doświadczenie użytkownika. Jej wartość to
nie ilość stworzonych instrukcji, ale stopień w jakim odpowiada na potrzeby
użytkownika. Treść wpływa w bardzo dużym stopniu na postrzeganie marki przez
klientów, dlatego jej jakość jest tak ważna.</p><p><a href="http://techwriter.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SoapNozUrbina.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" alt="SoapNozUrbina" src="/assets/images/SoapNozUrbina-f0c5d1ffe740f880c840c0895eba1eee.png" width="545" height="69" class="img_ev3q"></a></p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tagi:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/news">news</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/z-kraju">z-kraju</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/infografiki">infografiki</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/konferencje">konferencje</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/spolecznosc">spolecznosc</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/uzytecznosc">uzytecznosc</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Nawigacja na stronie listy wpisów na blogu"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/tags/spolecznosc/page/61"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Nowsze wpisy</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/tags/spolecznosc/page/63"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Starsze wpisy</div></a></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="footer__links text--center"><div class="footer__links"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/techwriterpl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Facebook<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a><span class="footer__link-separator">·</span><a href="http://x.com/techwriterpl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">X.com (dawny Twitter)<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a><span class="footer__link-separator">·</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/techwriter-pl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Linkedin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2023 techwriter.pl</div></div></div></footer></div>
