<a href="http://techwriter.pl/write-the-docs-europe-2016-relacja/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tutaj</a>) poznaliśmy
wiele ciekawych osób. Jedną z nich jest Brad Schmidt - kiedyś tester w Dolinie
Krzemowej, a obecnie Tech Writer w stolicy Czech. Zobaczcie jak to się robi u
naszych południowych sąsiadów.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-long-have-you-been-working-as-a-tech-writer">How long have you been working as a Tech Writer?<a href="#how-long-have-you-been-working-as-a-tech-writer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do How long have you been working as a Tech Writer?" title="Bezpośredni link do How long have you been working as a Tech Writer?">​</a></h3><p>A little more than 10 years.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-did-you-become-a-tech-writer">How did you become a Tech Writer?<a href="#how-did-you-become-a-tech-writer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do How did you become a Tech Writer?" title="Bezpośredni link do How did you become a Tech Writer?">​</a></h3><p>It was a lucky accident! I&#x27;d done QA for years in Silicon Valley, but sort of
burnt out by 2001, which lead me to come to the Czech Republic to teach English
in 2002. After a couple years, a colleague at a school I taught at demanded that
I give him my CV because there were so many IT jobs coming to Prague after they
joined the EU. Shortly thereafter I interviewed for a Tech Writer job. My sales
pitch was that writing user documentation was like writing test cases and bug
reports except the result was a positive one. Ten years on, I&#x27;m still doing it.

a mix of agile and waterfall projects.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-tools-do-you-use-and-what-do-you-think-about-them">What tools do you use and what do you think about them?<a href="#what-tools-do-you-use-and-what-do-you-think-about-them" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do What tools do you use and what do you think about them?" title="Bezpośredni link do What tools do you use and what do you think about them?">​</a></h3><p>We are locked into using Word, SharePoint, and a secure repository for finished
work. It&#x27;s very old fashioned, but there is a movement to modernize our
workflow. I&#x27;d rather be using a proper version control system and a more
lightweight document format, but the nice people and work environment more than
make up for it. 😊</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-do-you-get-the-information-you-need-to-preparecreate-documentation">How do you get the information you need to prepare/create documentation?<a href="#how-do-you-get-the-information-you-need-to-preparecreate-documentation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do How do you get the information you need to prepare/create documentation?" title="Bezpośredni link do How do you get the information you need to prepare/create documentation?">​</a></h3><p>You name it. :D Meetings, wiki pages, IM, tech talks, tea kettle conversations.
The more I know, the better questions I can ask. Having an SME prepare drafts of
the more technical content is still the best case scenario, though. Usually a QA
lead, dev lead, or product manager can be more helpful if you are very specific
about the answers you need to prepare the documentation.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-documents-do-you-deliver-in-what-form-in-which-languages-and-how-are-they-published">What documents do you deliver, in what form, in which language(s) and how are they published?<a href="#what-documents-do-you-deliver-in-what-form-in-which-languages-and-how-are-they-published" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do What documents do you deliver, in what form, in which language(s) and how are they published?" title="Bezpośredni link do What documents do you deliver, in what form, in which language(s) and how are they published?">​</a></h3><p>Currently they are all auditory compliance documents that describe systems,

published to a secure repository that auditors can access.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="do-you-participate-in-any-other-activities-besides-documentation-writing-eg-creating-marketing-materials-if-yes-what-is-it-and-what-tools-do-you-use">Do you participate in any other activities besides documentation writing (e.g. creating marketing materials)?

If yes, what is it and what tools do you use?">​</a></h3><p>In the past I&#x27;ve helped with product fact sheets, occasional marketing copy, and
proof-reading colleagues&#x27; slides and proposals. I love leading workshops and
training sessions when the chance comes. When I worked in Singapore, I was lucky
enough to travel to some interesting places while training people for  a new IT
system. I&#x27;ve also done a fair amount of narration for promotional videos and
screencasts (video tutorials) and am doing that a lot at my current job. For
video I&#x27;ve used Camtasia and/or Captivate. For audio it seems everyone uses
Audacity unless they are in a professional studio.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-the-biggest-challenges-at-your-work">What are the biggest challenges at your work?<a href="#what-are-the-biggest-challenges-at-your-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do What are the biggest challenges at your work?" title="Bezpośredni link do What are the biggest challenges at your work?">​</a></h3><p>Writing in a busy office with lots of distractions.

done I need to work at home or stay late at the office.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-do-you-like-the-most-in-technical-writing">What do you like the most in technical writing?<a href="#what-do-you-like-the-most-in-technical-writing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do What do you like the most in technical writing?" title="Bezpośredni link do What do you like the most in technical writing?">​</a></h3><p>Using language with economy and precision is harder than it seems, but I enjoy
that challenge a lot. The best experiences were when I worked on an open source
project. We would get direct feedback from users about how something helped
them, or ways the documentation could be improved. Unfortunately, direct user
communication is too rare in technical communication.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-your-advice-for-those-who-want-to-begin-their-adventure-with-writing-documentation">What is your advice for those who want to begin their adventure with writing documentation?<a href="#what-is-your-advice-for-those-who-want-to-begin-their-adventure-with-writing-documentation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do What is your advice for those who want to begin their adventure with writing documentation?" title="Bezpośredni link do What is your advice for those who want to begin their adventure with writing documentation?">​</a></h3><p>I try not to ever give advice. :D There&#x27;s a lot of information about how to get
started in technical writing out on the web already. Basically, I&#x27;d say start
small and use an existing tutorial, guide, or FAQ that you like as a model for
what you want your documentation to look like. The first FAQ&#x27;s I wrote were when
I worked in tech support. It built up from there as my roles changed into
full-time writing.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="do-people-in-the-czech-republic-know-what-a-technical-writer-is">Do people in the Czech Republic know what a Technical Writer is?<a href="#do-people-in-the-czech-republic-know-what-a-technical-writer-is" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Do people in the Czech Republic know what a Technical Writer is?" title="Bezpośredni link do Do people in the Czech Republic know what a Technical Writer is?">​</a></h3><p>Not unless they are an IT recruiter :D Seriously, I haven&#x27;t worked any place
where more than a small percentage of people know about tech writers.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="is-there-any-organization-that-unites-technical-writers-in-the-czech-republic-how-does-it-work">Is there any organization that unites Technical Writers in the Czech Republic?

How does it work?" title="Bezpośredni link do Is there any organization that unites Technical Writers in the Czech Republic? How does it work?">​</a></h3><p>None that I know about, currently. There was a group a few years ago that I was
a member of from 2008, but it fell apart after a couple years. I could start a
Meetup group, but these tend to devolve into beer drinking events. Though that&#x27;s
not a totally bad thing. 😊</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="are-there-any-tech-comm-conferences-in-the-czech-republic">Are there any tech comm conferences in the Czech Republic?<a href="#are-there-any-tech-comm-conferences-in-the-czech-republic" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Are there any tech comm conferences in the Czech Republic?" title="Bezpośredni link do Are there any tech comm conferences in the Czech Republic?">​</a></h3><p>None that I know of besides the last two Write the Docs.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="do-you-have-any-diploma-or-certificate-in-technical-writing-if-yes-did-it-help-you-in-your-career">Do you have any diploma or certificate in technical writing?

If yes, did it help you in your career?" title="Bezpośredni link do Do you have any diploma or certificate in technical writing? If yes, did it help you in your career?">​</a></h3><p>I studied Economics at University and ended up in tech by learning on-the-go
because those were the only decent jobs available in Silicon Valley. I think
tech writing is a very specialized corner of the IT world that unites a broad
set of skills. IMHO there are too many pointless IT certificates out there
already, but for someone at an earlier stage of their career I can see how it
could be useful.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-does-the-labor-market-look-for-tech-writers-in-the-czech-republic-how-many-job-offers-are-there-on-average-monthly-yearly-etc">How does the labor market look for Tech Writers in the Czech Republic?

How many job offers are there on average (monthly, yearly etc.)?">​</a></h3><p>It seems pretty good. There&#x27;s always openings, but I don&#x27;t have any exact
statistics to share. You&#x27;d have to ask Glassdoor or LinkedIn that one.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-the-salary-for-tech-writers-in-the-czech-republic">What is the salary for Tech Writers in the Czech Republic?<a href="#what-is-the-salary-for-tech-writers-in-the-czech-republic" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do What is the salary for Tech Writers in the Czech Republic?" title="Bezpośredni link do What is the salary for Tech Writers in the Czech Republic?">​</a></h3><p>It varies a lot depending on the company and your experience. For multinational
companies it&#x27;s much cheaper here than in Silicon Valley, other parts of the US,
or London. Compared to the cost of living, the wages are much better than the
local average so I&#x27;m satisfied with it.</p><p>W razie dodatkowych pytań możecie skontaktować się z Bradem bezpośrednio przez

Czasami jest to szansa
na zmianę kierunku swojej kariery zawodowej. Tak właśnie stało się w przypadku
Piotra, który nauczanie języka angielskiego postanowił zamienić na tworzenie
dokumentacji. Obecnie na swoim koncie ma już kilka lat doświadczenia w branży,
dlatego postanowiliśmy go namówić, żeby opowiedział nam trochę o swojej
przygodzie z komunikacją techniczną. Zapraszamy na kolejny odcinek z cyklu

Pierwsze lata po studiach pracowałem
jako nauczyciel języka angielskiego, jednak redukcja zatrudnienia w szkole
zmusiła mnie do szukania innego zajęcia. Traf chciał, że w firmie gdzie pracował
<a href="http://techwriter.pl/kilka-pytan-do-czesc-8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mój przyjaciel</a> rozpoczęła się
duża rekrutacja do zespołu dokumentacyjnego. Do końca nie zdawałem sobie sprawy
o co w tej pracy chodzi, ale wydawało mi się to ciekawe. Wziąłem udział w
rekrutacji, zostałem zatrudniony z innymi 8-10 osobami i tak zaczęła się moja
przygoda z technical writingiem. Było to duże wyzwanie i zmiana w moim życiu,
gdyż musiałem się także przeprowadzić do Krakowa.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="czy-możesz-opowiedzieć-coś-o-swojej-firmie-i-zespole-w-którym-pracujesz">Czy możesz opowiedzieć coś o swojej firmie i zespole w którym pracujesz?<a href="#czy-możesz-opowiedzieć-coś-o-swojej-firmie-i-zespole-w-którym-pracujesz" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Czy możesz opowiedzieć coś o swojej firmie i zespole w którym pracujesz?" title="Bezpośredni link do Czy możesz opowiedzieć coś o swojej firmie i zespole w którym pracujesz?">​</a></h3><p>Firma, pod której logiem obecnie pracuję obchodziła w tamtym roku 10. urodziny.
Trzy lata temu zostaliśmy przejęci przez globalnego potentata zajmującego się
tworzeniem oprogramowania do zarządzania procesami biznesowymi. Część osób
pracuje w firmie od samego początku, co bardzo pozytywnie wpływa na budowanie
dobrej atmosfery w pracy i miłych relacji. Zespół writerski tworzy obecnie 10
osób z czego 2 pracują od samego początku. Warto podkreślić że 6 osób znalazło
zatrudnienie w ostatnim roku. W skrócie: rozrastamy się jak cała branża IT w
Krakowie, i nie powiedzieliśmy jeszcze ostatniego słowa.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="w-jaki-sposób-jest-zorganizowana-praca-twoja-i-twojego-zespołu">W jaki sposób jest zorganizowana praca Twoja i Twojego zespołu?<a href="#w-jaki-sposób-jest-zorganizowana-praca-twoja-i-twojego-zespołu" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do W jaki sposób jest zorganizowana praca Twoja i Twojego zespołu?" title="Bezpośredni link do W jaki sposób jest zorganizowana praca Twoja i Twojego zespołu?">​</a></h3><p>Jesteśmy podzieleni na kilkuosobowe zespoły, w których każdy z dokumentalistów

naszej firmy). Kilkumiesięczny okres kiedy tworzy się nowa wersja produktu i
dokumentacja mamy podzielony na dwutygodniowe sprinty. W tym czasie,
systematycznie opisujemy te funkcjonalności, które zostały już zaimplementowane.
Nasza dokumentacja jest sprawdzana pod kątem poprawności technicznej i
językowej, a ostatecznie musi zyskać aprobatę edytora i głównego menedżera
odpowiedzialnego za całokształt naszej pracy. Chwilami jest to proces powolny,
ale jesteśmy pewni, że końcowy produkt jest bardzo dobrej jakości. Jest to nawet
po części naszym mottem, aby w procesie tworzenia dokumentacji jakość stawiać

niestety jest odwrotnie proporcjonalna do ceny. Z sentymentem i łezką w oku
wspominam edytor Oxygen i gitowe repozytorium, które po zapamiętaniu (czytaj
spisaniu w notesiku) kilku komend było moim sprawdzonym orężem pisarskim.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="w-jaki-sposób-zdobywasz-informacje-potrzebne-do-tworzenia-dokumentacji">W jaki sposób zdobywasz informacje potrzebne do tworzenia dokumentacji?<a href="#w-jaki-sposób-zdobywasz-informacje-potrzebne-do-tworzenia-dokumentacji" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do W jaki sposób zdobywasz informacje potrzebne do tworzenia dokumentacji?" title="Bezpośredni link do W jaki sposób zdobywasz informacje potrzebne do tworzenia dokumentacji?">​</a></h3><p>Odpowiadając krótko: w różny. Najczęściej biorę udział w demowaniu
oprogramowania lub oglądam nagrania, na których zespoły developerskie
przedstawiają nowe funkcjonalności produktu. Zdarza mi się umawiać na sesje ‘one
on one’, aby dokładnie dopytać o zmiany w produkcie i poznać lepiej nowe
funkcjonalności. Mam dostęp do gotowego produktu jak i do produktu w fazie
developerskiej. Mogę się zalogować, przetestować funkcjonalność samemu. Bardzo
często korzystam z projektów jakie tworzą UX designerzy dla zespołów
developerskich. Jest to dobry moment aby wyłapać wszelkie nieścisłości i
podzielić się tym z zespołem developerskim. Robię duży research, planuję swoją
pracę, a najwięcej czasu spędzam na „zabawie” z produktem: klikam, ustawiam
parametry, przechodzę wizardy, szukam bugów, a najczęściej generuję errory i
alerty. Nieodzownym elementem mojej pracy jest zadawanie dużej ilości pytań. Są
to, jakże by inaczej, ‘oczywiste pytania’ (przynajmniej w mniemaniu zespołów
developerskich).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="jakie-dokumenty-dostarczasz-w-jakiej-postaci-w-jakim-języku-i-jak-są-one-publikowane">Jakie dokumenty dostarczasz, w jakiej postaci, w jakim języku i jak są one publikowane?<a href="#jakie-dokumenty-dostarczasz-w-jakiej-postaci-w-jakim-języku-i-jak-są-one-publikowane" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Jakie dokumenty dostarczasz, w jakiej postaci, w jakim języku i jak są one publikowane?" title="Bezpośredni link do Jakie dokumenty dostarczasz, w jakiej postaci, w jakim języku i jak są one publikowane?">​</a></h3><p>Główny dokument to on-line help, który dołączamy do naszego sztandarowego

e-learningowe szkolenie trafi do naszych klientów, jestem ‘pierwszym
użytkownikiem’. Dodatkowo zdarza mi się robić mini prezentacje na temat tych
funkcjonalności, które opisuję. Jest to często niezbędne, aby przybliżyć innym
tech writerom mój komponent platformy i ułatwić im peer review tego, co
napisałem. W ostatnim czasie, co raz częściej zdarza się, że nowe
funkcjonalności wpływają na więcej niż jeden element platformy co wymaga
współpracy dwóch lub kilku tech writerów z różnych stref czasowych.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="jakie-są-największe-wyzwania-które-napotykasz-w-swojej-pracy">Jakie są największe wyzwania, które napotykasz w swojej pracy?<a href="#jakie-są-największe-wyzwania-które-napotykasz-w-swojej-pracy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Jakie są największe wyzwania, które napotykasz w swojej pracy?" title="Bezpośredni link do Jakie są największe wyzwania, które napotykasz w swojej pracy?">​</a></h3><p>W wielu rozmowach z innymi kolegami z branży, a także chwilami u siebie w pracy,
mam wrażenie, że dokumentacja zawsze traktowana jest po macoszemu i nikt
(inżynierowie, czy produkt ownerzy) nie mają czasu, aby poświęcić tech writerom
trochę więcej uwagi. Później, gdy użytkownicy zaczynają używać produkt to bardzo
szybko wynajdują braki lub nieścisłości w dokumentacji i taka dokumentacja wraca
na stół kreślarski. Jako tech writerzy, chyba każdy z nas spotyka się z sytuacją
że rozwiązaniem na braki produktowe lub nie do końca dobrze działające
funkcjonalności jest opisanie tego w dokumentacji w taki sposób, aby użytkownik
produktu był zadowolony z tego co jest. No cóż, nie zawsze udaje się dopiąć
wszystko na ostatni guzik w produkcie i trzeba z czegoś zrezygnować, lub
dostarczyć w późniejszym terminie.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="co-najbardziej-lubisz-w-pracy-tech-writera">Co najbardziej lubisz w pracy Tech Writera?<a href="#co-najbardziej-lubisz-w-pracy-tech-writera" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Co najbardziej lubisz w pracy Tech Writera?" title="Bezpośredni link do Co najbardziej lubisz w pracy Tech Writera?">​</a></h3><p>Lubię ten moment kiedy zrozumiem nową funkcjonalność produktu, mam wszystkie
dostępne materiały, nie mam więcej spotkań w kalendarzu i na spokojnie mogę
sobie pisać dokumentację do mojej ulubionej muzyki. Czuję wówczas, że dobrze
spędziłem dzień. Szybko mija tydzień, a artykułów w helpie przybywa. Do tego
dochodzą elastyczne godziny pracy i organizowanie pracy na własną rękę. Bardzo
lubię kiedy podczas rozmów i prezentacji nowych funkcjonalności produktu jest
chwila, aby porozmawiać o tym co słychać w Indiach, Amsterdamie lub Bostonie.
Lubię tą różnorodność kultur w pracy i łatwo dostrzegam, że ludzie z Azji,
Europy i Ameryki, z którymi mam przyjemność współpracować oglądają te sam
seriale, mają podobne poczucie humoru i starają się sobie nawzajem pomóc.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="co-byś-radził-osobom-które-chciałyby-zacząć-swoją-przygodę-z-pisaniem-dokumentacji">Co byś radził osobom, które chciałyby zacząć swoją przygodę z pisaniem dokumentacji?<a href="#co-byś-radził-osobom-które-chciałyby-zacząć-swoją-przygodę-z-pisaniem-dokumentacji" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Co byś radził osobom, które chciałyby zacząć swoją przygodę z pisaniem dokumentacji?" title="Bezpośredni link do Co byś radził osobom, które chciałyby zacząć swoją przygodę z pisaniem dokumentacji?">​</a></h3><p>Dodać stronkę techwriter.pl do ulubionych i wpaść na
<a href="http://soapconf.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">konferencję SOAP</a> na dobry początek. Zaczynając przygodę
z pisaniem dokumentacji nie należy się zrażać na samym początku. Pierwszy rok,
dwa dają już dużą perspektywę. Patrząc na pierwsze inwencje twórcze, można by
się pod nosem uśmiechnąć jak to się człowiek nieraz ‘popisał’. Co więcej w tym
temacie? Warto spróbować swoich sił w dwóch, trzech firmach, aby wyrobić sobie
pogląd na pracę tech writera. Dobrze jest znaleźć firmę, która umożliwia wyjazdy
i pracę z zespołami, które zlokalizowane są poza Polską. Firmę, która chętnie
wysyła pracowników na szkolenia i konferencje.</p><p>Jeśli chcecie skontakować się z Piotrem albo sami macie ochotę podzielić się

Po tym łagodnym wprowadzeniu, postanowiliśmy Was rzucić na głęboką wodę, czyli
zająć się zagadnieniem conkeyref. Dzięki temu zapoznacie się z koncepcją kluczy
i pobierania treści w dicie. Dla ułatwienia posłużymy się praktycznym
przykładem, który mamy nadzieję pozwoli Wam szybko zrozumieć o co w tym
wszystkim chodzi.</p><h1>Czym jest conkeyref?</h1><p><a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.2/os/spec/common/theconkeyrefattribute.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Conkeyref</a>
to specjalny odsyłacz, który wstawia treść z innego topika znajdującego się w
tej samej mapie ditowej. Na tym etapie prawdopodobnie ta definicja brzmi jeszcze
zagadkowo. W dalszych sekcjach znajdziecie więcej szczegółów, które powinny
rozjaśnić o co chodzi.</p><h1>Przykład użycia</h1><p>Załóżmy, że mamy topik wymieniający produkty, które sprzedajemy. Ten topik jest
używany we wszystkich naszych publikacjach i wygląda tak:</p><p><a href="http://techwriter.pl/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/generic-products-we-sell.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img

Jest on wpięty do mapy na samym początku pierwszego rozdziału.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tak-naprawdę-to-jeden-topik">Tak naprawdę, to jeden topik<a href="#tak-naprawdę-to-jeden-topik" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Tak naprawdę, to jeden topik" title="Bezpośredni link do Tak naprawdę, to jeden topik">​</a></h2><p>Topik, który zostanie użyty w manualu zawiera odwołania do nazw produktów w
odpowiednim miejscu:</p><ph conkeyref="product-names/**G600**"></ph><ph conkeyref="product-names/**S9000**"></ph><p>Odwołania używają id, które ustawiliśmy w naszych topikach-bibliotekach oraz
klucza &quot;product-names&quot;. Nasz topik włączamy do
<a href="http://techwriter.pl/wszystko-o-dita-podstawy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mapy ditowej</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="odwołanie-do-klucza-jest-kluczem-do-sukcesu">Odwołanie do klucza jest kluczem do sukcesu<a href="#odwołanie-do-klucza-jest-kluczem-do-sukcesu" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Odwołanie do klucza jest kluczem do sukcesu" title="Bezpośredni link do Odwołanie do klucza jest kluczem do sukcesu">​</a></h2><p>Ustawiając odwołanie w topiku, nie odwołaliśmy się do nazwy pliku biblioteki,
ale do klucza. Klucz umieszczamy w mapie ditowej w następujący sposób:</p><keydef keys="**product-names**" href="reuse/generic\_product\_names.dita"></keydef><p>Element keydef zawiera naszą nazwę klucza &quot;product-names&quot; oraz odwołanie do
pliku generic_product_names.dita, dlatego nasze odwołanie ma postać:</p><p>product-names/G600</p><p>Zamiast</p><p>generic_product_names.dita/G600</p><p>Dzięki temu możemy w innej mapie umieścić odwołanie do klucza z inną nazwą
pliku:</p><keydef keys="product-names" href="reuse/**european\_product\_names.dita**"></keydef><h1>Próbka do pobrania</h1><p><a href="http://techwriter.pl/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/product_catalogditamap-bundle.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tutaj</a>
możecie pobrać pliki DITA, które obrazują przykład użycia opisany powyżej.
Poniżej opis paczki, którą możecie ściągnąć:</p><ol><li>Mapa &quot;generic&quot; odwołuje się do tabeli nazw podstawowych.</li><li>Mapa &quot;european&quot; odwołuje się do tabeli nazw na Europę.</li><li>Folder &quot;reuse&quot; zawiera obie tabele nazw.</li><li>Plik topic.xml jest użyty w obu mapach.</li></ol><p>W następnym odcinku napiszemy jak takie pliki otworzyć i jak wyprodukować z nich
PDFa. Dajcie znać w komentarzach jak Wam się podoba i o czym chcielibyście
przeczytać następnym razem.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tagi:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/dobre-praktyki">dobre-praktyki</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/przyklady">przyklady</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/warsztat">warsztat</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/dita">dita</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/manuale">manuale</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/on-line-help">on-line-help</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/pomoc-uzytkownika">pomoc-uzytkownika</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/technologie">technologie</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Nawigacja na stronie listy wpisów na blogu"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/tags/warsztat/page/32"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Nowsze wpisy</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/tags/warsztat/page/34"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Starsze wpisy</div></a></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="footer__links text--center"><div class="footer__links"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/techwriterpl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Facebook<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a><span class="footer__link-separator">·</span><a href="http://x.com/techwriterpl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">X.com (dawny Twitter)<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a><span class="footer__link-separator">·</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/techwriter-pl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Linkedin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2023 techwriter.pl</div></div></div></footer></div>
