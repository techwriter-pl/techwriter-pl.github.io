<a href="http://techwriter.pl/soap-2014-relacja-z-pierwszego-dnia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the day 1 summary</a>
that we published some time ago. Enjoy!</p><p>After our general summary, it’s time to get down to the nitty-gritty. Today we
are providing you with a short overview of the presentations that were delivered
during the first day of <a href="http://soapconf.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the soap! 2014 conference</a>.</p><p><a href="http://techwriter.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/DSC6686.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" alt="soap! 2014 audience" src="/assets/images/DSC6686-1024x489-86725ff9c34f7ca129935b9ed859447c.jpg" width="1024" height="489" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="games-not-only-for-kids">Games not only for kids<a href="#games-not-only-for-kids" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Games not only for kids" title="Bezpośredni link do Games not only for kids">​</a></h2><p>The honour of warming up the audience fell to
<a href="http://soapconf.com/speakers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monika Konieczny</a>. She started her presentation
with a story about a cat called Teodor who wanted to help its owner and do the
laundry. For a moment we were wondering where the story was going. The finale
was quite drastic because Teodor almost died buried under a voluminous and
badly-written manual. Monika tried to show how to avoid such tragedies. As we’ve
already heard more than once, manuals are too long, too boring, and
incomprehensible. What’s more, it’s difficult to find a common denominator for
the readers of the manual because each of us pays attention to different
details, and the way we use a particular product often depends on how much
experience we have with it. Additionally, there are problems of linguistic
nuances and a high context culture, like the Polish one. The first step to
solving these issues is creating the user profile and narrowing down the
characteristics of the target audience. You also have to put yourself in the
user’s shoes, try to create potential stress situations to understand how the
user might feel in such moments and what information he or she will need. Monika
also tried to convince us that technical documentation does not have to be
boring. It’s enough to give it characteristics of a novel and write it so that
we would want to read it ourselves. Everyone wants to feel like a superhero.
According to Monika, we should use this fact to our advantage and create
documentation that makes users feel that each thing they learn from that
documentation gives them new superpowers. Apart from the novel aspect, we also
heard about introducing elements of a game into documents, a.k.a. gamification.
The mere addition of ranks and badges is no longer sufficient as the users get
bored quickly. It’s possible to introduce microgames - smaller challenges that
the user can undertake - or exploration of the interface where a particular
action triggers a response from the system and allows for discovering new
functions. Monika’s examples of increasing the attractiveness of documentation
by introducing elements of novels and games included a comic book for Ruby
programmers, <a href="http://www.ribbonhero.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ribbon Hero 2</a> – the great return of
the well-known Clippy from MS Office, and the
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stack Overflow portal</a>.</p><p><a href="http://techwriter.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SoapMonikaKonieczny.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" alt="SoapMonikaKonieczny" src="/assets/images/SoapMonikaKonieczny-617f2c0dca604372009bc4eaef4ddcdf.jpg" width="570" height="57" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="plenty-is-sometimes-a-plague">Plenty is sometimes a plague<a href="#plenty-is-sometimes-a-plague" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Plenty is sometimes a plague" title="Bezpośredni link do Plenty is sometimes a plague">​</a></h2><p>As we were told by <a href="http://soapconf.com/speakers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kasia Mrowca</a>, the same is
the case for a surplus of functions in an application. Clients always want to
add many new functionalities to their app. Before we satisfy their needs, we
should stop for a moment and think where their requirements come from. Sometimes
the problem lies in the process and adding a new option to the interface doesn’t
change anything. It’s the process that needs to be modified. Sometimes new
functions are requested out of habit. Someone has always had one switch or the
other in the previous software and wants to have the same one in the new
application even though it’s completely unnecessary. Kasia mentioned the pareto
rule according to which 80% of users use only 20% of functions, Microsoft Word
can be an example here. Each new function makes the application more complex. It
translates into its usability and the level of complexity of the accompanying
documentation. One has to know the limit just like with eating chocolate. After
a certain amount, it’s no longer a pleasure.<br>
<!-- -->So, how do we stay sane? All departments in the company have to cooperate on a
friendly basis. Instead of interfering with one another, let’s exchange ideas.
Let’s not focus only on our field, but keep the common goal in mind at all
times. At the end, a warning from the presentation: never show a model of an
application that is too similar to the final version because the clients will
want to have the application immediately.</p><p><a href="http://techwriter.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SoapKasiaMrowca.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" alt="SoapKasiaMrowca" src="/assets/images/SoapKasiaMrowca-5af85eae05acb022f3aca9f594a54a91.jpg" width="551" height="114" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="learning-by-entertaining">Learning by entertaining<a href="#learning-by-entertaining" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Learning by entertaining" title="Bezpośredni link do Learning by entertaining">​</a></h2><p>E-learning, like life, is all about choices. Not to waste words,
<a href="http://soapconf.com/speakers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sabina Misiarz-Filipek</a> started her presentation
with a video that was divided into parts. After each part we had to choose what
should happen next thus deciding how the story developed. Unfortunately, we
killed the main hero. However, this wasn’t the most important thing. What really
mattered was that we could learn without feeling bored. Before we start creating
a training we need to specify the target audience and the level of their
computer literacy as it impacts how they will feel during the course. Sabina
referred to, among others,
<a href="http://www.learning-theories.com/kellers-arcs-model-of-motivational-design.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the ARCS didactic model</a>.
The main factor which keeps the users’ attention during the training is their
motivation. It’s also important how relevant to them are the skills that they
are going to gain during the training. We can build user confidence by informing
them how long the training will last, what form it will have, and what hardware
will be required. The level of satisfaction can be increased by adding funny
elements, interesting images and elements of a game. In the past, the strategy
of creating e-learnings assumed a smaller number of long courses. Currently, the
trend is to create a bigger number of shorter courses, games, videos, or
infographics. During the presentation, Sabina provided many interesting
examples. One of them was an introductory course for new employees in the form
of a game. Another example was <a href="https://life-saver.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lifesaver</a> – a game
in the form of a movie that teaches how to make proper choices in emergency
situations that we can encounter in everyday life.</p><p><a href="http://techwriter.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SoapSabinaMisiarzFilipek.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" alt="SoapSabinaMisiarzFilipek" src="/assets/images/SoapSabinaMisiarzFilipek-4f67ddf97034b5cc929ae3d3c2c5f6ec.png" width="570" height="65" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-power-of-the-diagram">The power of the diagram<a href="#the-power-of-the-diagram" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do The power of the diagram" title="Bezpośredni link do The power of the diagram">​</a></h2><p>It has long been known that “a picture is worth a thousand words.” This old
truth was demonstrated by <a href="http://soapconf.com/speakers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kevin Duncan</a>, who
showed how to skilfully use diagrams to make stories we tell more interesting
and concise. One such method is the “whittling wedge”. We start from a wide
range of options, approximately 10, then narrow the choice down to around 3
options. In the end we recommend one of them. Another method is the “bow tie”.
We start our story from a few options, recommend one of them and then move on to
a broader discussion expanding the details. A diagram that shows the
&quot;motivational dip&quot; is also an interesting example. At the beginning, when we
take on something new, we experience a rapid increase in motivation, which lasts
up to a point. Then comes the decline in motivation and the stabilization phase
during which we learn. This phase may end with either success or failure. In
order to streamline our activities we can use the “priority matrix”. With the
help of four criteria - urgent, not urgent, important and unimportant – we
divide the area into four sections. The first one includes matters which are
urgent and unimportant and can be delegated or performed straightaway. The
second section contains urgent and important matters that we need to address
immediately. The third section covers matters which are not urgent and not
important. They can be ignored. The last section contains issues that are not
urgent but important. They must be considered and planned. During his
presentation, Kevin gave many other examples that came from his book
<a href="http://www.thediagramsbook.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“The Diagrams Book”</a>. In addition to the use of
diagrams, we’ve also learned one more important thing. Using the word s<!-- -->*<!-- -->*<!-- -->t
isn&#x27;t out of place during a presentation 😉</p><p><a href="http://techwriter.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SoapKevinDuncan.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" alt="SoapKevinDuncan" src="/assets/images/SoapKevinDuncan-e6a6fe189e51f5c0e7bcaa4c9f11dfea.jpg" width="555" height="58" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="valuable-experience">Valuable experience<a href="#valuable-experience" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Valuable experience" title="Bezpośredni link do Valuable experience">​</a></h2><p>Unfortunately, the last presentation wasn’t utterly clear, at least for us.
<a href="http://soapconf.com/speakers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rajeev Kumar Tiwari and Rajesh Khurana</a> couldn’t
come to Krakow and so they presented remotely. It considerably affected the
level of understanding the speakers who talked about user experience. They
started with explaining that UX is a very broad term that can’t be defined in a
few words. It&#x27;s a cross-discipline into which companies need to invest to be
able to develop. It isn’t a layer or a component of a product but its integral
part that isn’t limited to a particular technology. Then, the speakers presented
the process of creating user experience and showed how the role of a technical
writer changed in that process.</p><p><a href="http://techwriter.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SoapRajeevRajesh.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" alt="SoapRajeevRajesh" src="/assets/images/SoapRajeevRajesh-56e102871a53aeb7118e2320829e3e29.jpg" width="567" height="61" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><p>Translated: Agnieszka Tkaczyk Proofread: Paweł Kowaluk</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tagi:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/news">news</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/z-kraju">z-kraju</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/konferencje">konferencje</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/spolecznosc">spolecznosc</a></li></ul></div></footer><div class="margin-top--lg margin-bottom--lg"><div id="disqus_thread"></div></div></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/konferencja-knowledge-management-solutions-relacja">Konferencja Knowledge Management Solutions - relacja</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2014-11-04T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">4 listopada 2014</time> · <!-- -->5 min aby przeczytać</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E03AQGZiA4dcmTlyQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1655570299536?e=1698883200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=SLVMi9yYgP3ef66ISxUs5CleeyFXRkYjB9Ff2_jWe7c" alt="Darek Drezno"><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><span itemprop="name">Darek Drezno</span></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Jakiś czas temu

wpływ na jego karierę!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="prawa-autorskie-i-tejemnica-przedsiębiorstwa---legalne-korzystanie-z-dokumentów-w-ramach-systemów-knowledge-management">Prawa autorskie i tejemnica przedsiębiorstwa - legalne korzystanie z dokumentów w ramach systemów Knowledge Management.<a href="#prawa-autorskie-i-tejemnica-przedsiębiorstwa---legalne-korzystanie-z-dokumentów-w-ramach-systemów-knowledge-management" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Prawa autorskie i tejemnica przedsiębiorstwa - legalne korzystanie z dokumentów w ramach systemów Knowledge Management." title="Bezpośredni link do Prawa autorskie i tejemnica przedsiębiorstwa - legalne korzystanie z dokumentów w ramach systemów Knowledge Management.">​</a></h2><p>Prawnik z kancelarii DZP skupił się na dwóch tematach:</p><ul><li>Ustawie o prawie autorskim.</li><li>Tajemnicy przedsiębiorstwa oraz ochronie tzw. know-how (na przykład za pomocą
umów NDA - non-diclosure agreements).</li></ul><p>Do tej pory zastanawiamy się, co chciał nam przekazać i dochodzimy do wniosku,
że codziennie łamiemy jakieś prawo, a jeśli nawet nie, to na pewno ktoś i tak
może nas pozwać. Ale z drugiej strony zawsze ktoś inny może nas wybronić.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="zarządzanie-wiedzą-w-strategiach-firm">Zarządzanie wiedzą w strategiach firm.<a href="#zarządzanie-wiedzą-w-strategiach-firm" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Zarządzanie wiedzą w strategiach firm." title="Bezpośredni link do Zarządzanie wiedzą w strategiach firm.">​</a></h2><p>Tak, istnieją firmy, które robią coś takiego! Można też o tym ciekawie
opowiadać! Pani profesor Irena Hejduk ze Szkoły Głównej Handlowej szczyci się
ponad 20-letnim doświadczeniem w zarządzaniu (nie tylko wiedzą) - i to było
widać. Naszym skromnym zdaniem jedna z dwóch najlepszych prezentacji całej
konferencji.</p><p>Dowiedzieliśmy się czym różnią się dane od informacji, co to jest wiedza, czym
różni się od pozostałych dwóch i dlaczego wiedza to nie mądrość. Odświeżające.</p><p><a href="http://techwriter.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/wiedza_madrosc.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" alt="wiedza_madrosc" src="/assets/images/wiedza_madrosc-12bf0e15b2f1f544788e38a7c66d75e8.jpg" width="672" height="447" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><p>Wystąpienie na dużym poziomie (również abstrakcji). Ale można było wychwycić
także bardzo praktyczne wskazówki. Na przykład taką - planując projekt dotyczący
przekazywania wiedzy, koniecznie upewnij się, że w zespole projektowym są nie
tylko posiadacze wiedzy, ale również odbiorcy. To oni wiedzą najlepiej jakie są
ich potrzeby!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="przeładowanie-informacyjne-information-overload---wyzwanie-dla-biznesu">Przeładowanie informacyjne (information overload) - wyzwanie dla biznesu.<a href="#przeładowanie-informacyjne-information-overload---wyzwanie-dla-biznesu" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Przeładowanie informacyjne (information overload) - wyzwanie dla biznesu." title="Bezpośredni link do Przeładowanie informacyjne (information overload) - wyzwanie dla biznesu.">​</a></h2><p>Ostatnia prezentacja - profesora Jana Fazlagica z Akademii Finansów i Biznesu
Vistula - miała najładniejszą szatę graficzną a prowadzący najbardziej się
spieszył 😊. Ale było bardzo ciekawie. Odwrotnie niż wszyscy poprzednicy,
wykładowca skupił się na tym, jak ograniczyć przepływ informacji i ograniczyć
efekt <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_overload" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">przeciążenia wiedzą</a>,
którego przecież wszyscy na co dzień doświadczamy.</p><p>Kilka haseł które zapadły nam w pamięć:</p><ul><li>W smartfonie jest około 250 000 patentów</li><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Smog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data smog</a></li><li>90% zawartości Internetu to opinie, a tylko 10% to fakty</li><li><a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/041057_internet_fatigue_information_overload_news.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Information Fatigue Syndrom</a>
(IFS)</li><li><a href="http://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/knowledge-database/cognitive-overload" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cognitive Overload</a></li><li><a href="http://leife.wordpress.com/2008/04/12/knowledge-navigation-quizzics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quizzics</a></li></ul><p>Wszystko to efekty niesamowicie niskiego kosztu produkcji i przekazywania
informacji w dzisiejszych czasach. Jesteśmy zarzucani newsami, analizami,
opiniami, książkami, a do tego, paradoksalnie, cały czas rośnie konsumpcja
papieru na świecie. Jak się przed tym bronić? - stosować filtry, personalizować
wyszukiwanie, ćwiczyć siłę woli, czytać streszczenia. Dokładna diagnoza problemu
i recepty - w dwóch książkach pana profesora, których nie omieszkał polecić
słuchaczom 😊</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="podsumowanie">Podsumowanie<a href="#podsumowanie" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Podsumowanie" title="Bezpośredni link do Podsumowanie">​</a></h2><p>Nasza relacja jest chyba dłuższa niż konferencja 😊, która wydaje się być
głównie wydarzeniem marketingowo-sprzedażowym. Trudno ją polecać, ale i trudno
odradzić, biorąc pod uwagę zerowy koszt uczestnictwa (poza czasem). Niektórym
uczestnikom udało się nawet wygrać ciekawe nagrody w końcowym losowaniu.
Większość prezentacji bardzo powierzchownie ślizgało się po tematach, ale
wynikało to zapewne z ograniczonych możliwości czasowych.</p><p>Dlaczego o niej w ogóle piszemy? Przede wszystkim dlatego, że praca techwritera
to właśnie praca z wiedzą, nad wiedzą i jej przekazywaniem. To jest sedno i
esencja naszej pracy - przekazywanie wiedzy. Chcemy również, abyście przez
moment zastanowili się nad tym, jak wygląda zarządzanie wiedzą w Waszej firmie.
I - jeśli nie jest idealnie - spróbowali coś zmienić. Warto.</p><p>A dodatkowo, oczywiście, chcieliśmy zamieścić w Internecie jeszcze jedną opinię,
zwiększyć Wasz IFS oraz cognitive overload oraz zagęścić data smog 😉.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tagi:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/news">news</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/z-kraju">z-kraju</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/knowledge-base">knowledge-base</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/konferencje">konferencje</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/zarzadzanie-wiedza">zarzadzanie-wiedza</a></li></ul></div></footer><div class="margin-top--lg margin-bottom--lg"><div id="disqus_thread"></div></div></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/konferencja-astc-nsw-2014">Konferencja ASTC (NSW) 2014</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2014-10-31T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">31 października 2014</time> · <!-- -->2 min aby przeczytać</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/docdeveloper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E03AQG4NlxT6Ac3qg/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1600402077676?e=1698883200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=7JE7WOrOlM6u6Sih8fAtUiU1jliABF5ieVepBO8lxCw" alt="Michał Skowron"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/docdeveloper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Michał Skowron</span></a></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Tym razem coś z innej części globu, a dokładniej z Australii. W dniach 17 i 18
października w Sydney odbyła się konferencja zorganizowana przez australijskie
stowarzyszenie na rzecz komunikacji technicznej
(<a href="http://astcnsw.org.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Australian Society for Technical Communication (NSW)</a>).
Niestety nie udało nam się wcisnąć tej konferencji w nasz napięty grafik,
dlatego nie możemy Wam przedstawić autorskiej relacji 😉 Na szczęście z
pomocą przychodzi Sarah Maddox, która była zarówno mówczynią i uczestniczką
podczas tego wydarzenia. Na swoim blogu
<a href="http://ffeathers.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ffeathers</a> zamieściła własne notatki z
konferencji. Jest całkiem sporo czytania, ponieważ autorka nie opisała tylko
jednej prezentacji. Lektura w sam raz na długie zimowe wieczory. Poniżej lista

dotyczącym konferencji Sarah przedstawia ogólne podsumowanie tego co się działo
oraz opis własnej prezentacji.</p><p>Interesujący zakres tematyczny. Może znajdziecie w tych prezentacjach jakąś
inspirację. Dla nas najciekawsze były prezentacje, które przedstawiały
praktyczne przykłady. Warto spojrzeć na prezentację Garetha Oakesa, który mówił
o tym jak wspólnie z firmą Repco budował system zarządzania treścią dla
przemysłu motoryzacyjnego oraz na prezentację Dave Gasha, który pokazał krok po
kroku jak stworzyć pomoc kontekstową w HTML i XML.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tagi:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/news">news</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/ze-swiata">ze-swiata</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/konferencje">konferencje</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/spolecznosc">spolecznosc</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/zarzadzanie-trescia">zarzadzanie-trescia</a></li></ul></div></footer><div class="margin-top--lg margin-bottom--lg"><div id="disqus_thread"></div></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Nawigacja na stronie listy wpisów na blogu"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/tags/news/page/65"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Nowsze wpisy</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/tags/news/page/67"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Starsze wpisy</div></a></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="footer__links text--center"><div class="footer__links"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/techwriterpl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Facebook<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a><span class="footer__link-separator">·</span><a href="http://x.com/techwriterpl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">X.com (dawny Twitter)<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a><span class="footer__link-separator">·</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/techwriter-pl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Linkedin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2023 techwriter.pl</div></div></div></footer></div>
