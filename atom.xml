        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Many people ask me, "What are the best resources available to help tech writers upskill in an AI world"?</p>
<p>You might be surprised to hear my usual&nbsp;answer, "I don't know."</p>
<p>Of course, I could shamelessly promote my newsletter Cyborg's Writing or my prompt engineering course with Firehead Digital Communications, but that seems self-serving... and doesn't really answer the question.</p>
<p>Why the uncertainty? The truth is, there are no core resources that I consistently turn to for upskilling in AI. For the past three years, my learning has been largely experiential, playing around with AI in my everyday life, solving content problems, and getting things done.</p>
<p>So the best way to upskill in AI is to use it. When you have a problem to solve, consider trying an AI tool. And when you have a question, research it.&nbsp;And when you discover something cool, share it.</p>
<p>The best resource we have for upskilling in AI is each other.</p>
<p>Like writing, developing our AI experience is best done in a community.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="first-dont-freak-out">First, Don't Freak Out<a href="https://techwriter.pl/tech-writers-upskill-ai#first-dont-freak-out" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do First, Don't Freak Out" title="Bezpośredni link do First, Don't Freak Out">​</a></h2>
<p>AI might seem intimidating, but there's no need to panic.</p>
<p>Yes, it's about creating machines that can think and learn like humans. Yes, it can process vast amounts of data at lightning speed.</p>
<p>But here's the thing: AI isn't here to replace us, especially not in the world of tech writing.</p>
<p>AI is a tool, and like any tool, it's here to help us. It can automate the repetitive tasks that take up so much of our time, freeing us up to focus on the more complex and creative aspects of our work. It can generate content, helping us produce more in less time.</p>
<p>But AI isn't just about making our jobs easier. It's also about improving the quality of our work. With AI, we can analyze our content in ways that were previously impossible, identifying patterns and insights that can help us improve our writing.</p>
<p>So, the first step in upskilling in an AI world? Don't freak out. Instead, recognize the potential of AI and learn how to harness it to your advantage. It's not about competing with AI, but collaborating with it.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="embrace-the-new-ways-of-thinking">Embrace the New Ways of Thinking<a href="https://techwriter.pl/tech-writers-upskill-ai#embrace-the-new-ways-of-thinking" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Embrace the New Ways of Thinking" title="Bezpośredni link do Embrace the New Ways of Thinking">​</a></h2>
<p>Change can be scary, but it's also an opportunity for growth.</p>
<p>In the world of tech writing, AI is that change. It's not just a new tool, but a new way of thinking about our work. It's about shifting from a mindset of creation to one of collaboration, working with AI to produce content that's more efficient, effective, and engaging.</p>
<p>Take prompt design, for instance. It's a skill that involves crafting specific instructions to guide AI in generating desired content. It's like teaching a new colleague how to write in your company's style, but the colleague is an AI. Mastering this skill can help you produce high-quality content quickly and consistently.</p>
<p>Or consider the use of copilot AI tools like <a href="http://lex.page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lex.page</a> or Herretto’s Etto , which integrate into your writing and content management systems. These tools don’t write for you, they help you come up with ideas, double-check your work, and solve content problems.</p>
<p>Just like any other colleague. This just happens to be a machines.</p>
<p>But embracing the change isn't just about learning new skills or using new tools. It's also about adapting your existing skills to new contexts.</p>
<p>For example, tech writers are experts at understanding users and user contexts. This can be invaluable in fine-tuning AI outputs, ensuring they meet the high standards of professional writing.</p>
<p>So stay curious and open-minded. Don't be afraid to dive in, play around, and see what you can discover.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="gaining-practical-experience">Gaining Practical Experience<a href="https://techwriter.pl/tech-writers-upskill-ai#gaining-practical-experience" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Gaining Practical Experience" title="Bezpośredni link do Gaining Practical Experience">​</a></h2>
<p>While understanding the theory behind AI and tech writing is important, nothing beats hands-on experience. It's through practical application that we truly understand how to collaborate with AI and see its potential.</p>
<p>Remember, the goal is not to become an AI expert overnight, but to start exploring and learning. So, don't be afraid to dive in, make mistakes, and learn as you go. The journey may be challenging, but it's also exciting and full of potential. Let's embrace it and see where it takes us.</p>
<p>So, how can you gain this experience? Here are a few project ideas to kickstart your AI learning journey.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="experiment-with-ai-writing-tools">Experiment with AI Writing Tools<a href="https://techwriter.pl/tech-writers-upskill-ai#experiment-with-ai-writing-tools" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Experiment with AI Writing Tools" title="Bezpośredni link do Experiment with AI Writing Tools">​</a></h3>
<p>Start by getting familiar with AI writing tools like lex.page or Microsoft Copilot. Use them to generate content, experiment with different prompts, and see how the AI responds. This will give you a feel for how AI can enhance your writing process.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="collaborate-with-ai-on-a-blog-post">Collaborate with AI on a Blog Post<a href="https://techwriter.pl/tech-writers-upskill-ai#collaborate-with-ai-on-a-blog-post" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Collaborate with AI on a Blog Post" title="Bezpośredni link do Collaborate with AI on a Blog Post">​</a></h3>
<p>Try writing a blog post in collaboration with AI. Use the AI to generate a first draft, then refine and edit the content yourself. This will give you a taste of what it's like to work with AI on a real project.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="create-a-prompt-library">Create a Prompt Library<a href="https://techwriter.pl/tech-writers-upskill-ai#create-a-prompt-library" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Create a Prompt Library" title="Bezpośredni link do Create a Prompt Library">​</a></h3>
<p>Develop a library of prompts for different types of content. This will help you understand how to guide AI effectively and see how different prompts produce different results.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="analyze-ai-generated-content">Analyze AI-Generated Content<a href="https://techwriter.pl/tech-writers-upskill-ai#analyze-ai-generated-content" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Analyze AI-Generated Content" title="Bezpośredni link do Analyze AI-Generated Content">​</a></h3>
<p>Take some time to analyze the content generated by AI. Look at what works, what doesn't, and why. This will help you understand how to refine your prompts and improve the quality of AI-generated content … and to know when not to use AI</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="share-your-experiences">Share Your Experiences<a href="https://techwriter.pl/tech-writers-upskill-ai#share-your-experiences" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Share Your Experiences" title="Bezpośredni link do Share Your Experiences">​</a></h3>
<p>Finally, share your experiences with others. Write about your experiments, discuss your findings, and exchange ideas with other tech writers. This will not only deepen your understanding but also contribute to the collective knowledge of our community.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="key-resources-for-upskilling-in-ai">Key Resources for Upskilling in AI<a href="https://techwriter.pl/tech-writers-upskill-ai#key-resources-for-upskilling-in-ai" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Key Resources for Upskilling in AI" title="Bezpośredni link do Key Resources for Upskilling in AI">​</a></h2>
<p>You shouldn't feel like you need to take a bunch of courses, read tons of books, or constantly be watching various blogs.</p>
<p>You will never keep up with the pace of AI development. But don't let that discourage you!</p>
<p>The key is to think about your goals as a tech writer, the problems you want to solve, and laser-target resources that help you get there.</p>
<p>Here are some places to start, depending on your specific goals:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-want-to-understand-the-basics-of-generative-ai-technology">I want to understand the basics of generative AI technology.<a href="https://techwriter.pl/tech-writers-upskill-ai#i-want-to-understand-the-basics-of-generative-ai-technology" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do I want to understand the basics of generative AI technology." title="Bezpośredni link do I want to understand the basics of generative AI technology.">​</a></h3>
<p>You shouldn’t have to pay to learn the basics. Here are some great, free resources.</p>
<p><strong>AI For Everyone</strong> by Andrew Ng on Coursera: This course is designed for non-technical audiences and gives a broad overview of the capabilities and limitations of AI. (<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-everyone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-everyone</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Elements of AI:</strong> This free online course gives a fantastic primer on the basics of AI, its concepts, and its potential impact on the world. (<a href="https://www.elementsofai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.elementsofai.com/</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Introduction to Artificial Intelligence:</strong> This beginner-level course is offered by Coursera in partnership with IBM. The course aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of AI, its applications, use cases, and how it is transforming our lives. <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-a</a>i?)</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-want-to-find-tools-to-experiment-with">I want to find tools to experiment with.<a href="https://techwriter.pl/tech-writers-upskill-ai#i-want-to-find-tools-to-experiment-with" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do I want to find tools to experiment with." title="Bezpośredni link do I want to find tools to experiment with.">​</a></h3>
<p>The amount of tools out there is ridiculous … many of them are just “GPT wrappers” or interfaces wrapped around the same genAI technlogy.</p>
<p>In many cases, you can eventually build these yourselves, but it’s good to see what’s out there.</p>
<p><strong>There’s An AI for That:</strong> This is a pretty robust database of AI tools, organized by purpose. There are a lot of terrible ones, but a great place to start. (<a href="https://theresanaiforthat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://theresanaiforthat.com/</a>)</p>
<p><strong>UX Tigers:</strong> A well-curated list of tools specifically for UX design. (<a href="https://www.uxtigers.com/post/top-ai-tools-for-ux" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.uxtigers.com/post/top-ai-tools-for-ux</a>)</p>
<p><strong>App Sumo:</strong> Not solely for AI tools, many of the best get started here. The few tools that I’ve paid, I received excellent deals here. The best part? You can try these apps for 60 days and get your money back, if it turns out to be a dud.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-want-explore-prompt-design-techniques">I want explore prompt design techniques.<a href="https://techwriter.pl/tech-writers-upskill-ai#i-want-explore-prompt-design-techniques" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do I want explore prompt design techniques." title="Bezpośredni link do I want explore prompt design techniques.">​</a></h2>
<p><strong>Prompt Engineering Guide:</strong> This goes over nearly all of the prompting techniques that have entered the mainstream, introducing you to the vocabulary and examples that can be transferred to technical writing. <a href="https://www.promptingguide.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(https://www.promptingguide.ai/</a>)</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers:</strong> This is a very basic course that shows you the key tasks that AI works best for and how they integrate into a development workflow. <a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Structured Prompting for Technical Communicators &amp; Content Developers:</strong> Well, I have to mention this, right? This is my course on managing prompts as technical writers, from prompt design to prompt management. (<a href="https://firehead-training.net/course/structuring-chat-gpt-prompts-for-technical-communicators" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://firehead-training.net/course/structuring-chat-gpt-prompts-for-technical-communicators</a>)</p>
<p>This isn’t even the tip of the iceberg, but should serve as a great place to get started from ground zero.</p>
<p>Remember, though, there is no such thing as an AI expert. No one knows everything there is to know about AI, because AI is a collaborative technology.</p>
<p>AI is incomplete without you.</p>
<p>The only expert you need is the one right in front of you … yourself.</p>
<p>You’re the most important person crafting your interaction with AI; ensuring it complements and enhances your work in the right ways.</p>
<p>Facing AI with a sense of agency and belonging can drastically alter your overall journey of upskilling in an ever-evolving AI world.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to hearing about what you learn in your adventures with AI!</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Jako technical writerzy dążymy do tworzenia dokumentacji, która cechuje się
jednolitym stylem i spójnością. W tych dążeniach wspomagają nas przeróżne
zestawy standardów, jednak ich liczba często potrafi być dość przytłaczająca i
sprawia, że marzymy o jednym, kompletnym przewodniku po stylu i standardach
pisania.</p>
<p>Jeżeli poszukiwania idealnego style guide'a spędzają Wam sen z powiek albo
chcielibyście poszerzyć swoją wiedzę w tym zakresie, zapraszamy do <strong>Forte
Spaces</strong> w dniu 09.05.2024. Podczas spotkania tematykę standardów i wytycznych
przybliży nam
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-turlej-468222254/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Adam Turlej</strong></a>, a po
prezentacji zapraszamy na wymianę opinii przy pizzy i napojach.</p>

<p><em>Wspólny mianownik: W poszukiwaniu uniwersalnych standardów tworzenia
dokumentacji</em></p>
<p>Podczas majowego spotkania weźmiemy pod lupę trzy zestawy standardów,
rozpatrując określone przez nie zasady tworzenia dokumentacji i użycia języka.
Wspólnie zastanowimy się, czy można na ich podstawie stworzyć uniwersalny zestaw
wytycznych pomocnych w codziennej pracy technical writera.</p>
<p>Naszym prelegentem będzie <strong>Adam Turlej</strong>, który tworzeniem dokumentacji
technicznej zajmuje się od 2020 roku. Technical writing zainteresował go w
trakcie studiów filologicznych na Uniwersytecie Jagiellońskim. W tworzeniu
treści ceni sobie minimalizm i modułowość. Kiedy nie pisze dokumentacji, Adam
zajmuje się tworzeniem muzyki. Jego utworów możecie posłuchać w

Mamy nadzieję, że nasze obserwacje i pomysły okażą się dla Was przydatne i że zainspirują Was do działania.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="kim-jesteśmy">Kim jesteśmy<a href="https://techwriter.pl/praca-w-zespole-rozproszonym#kim-jeste%C5%9Bmy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Kim jesteśmy" title="Bezpośredni link do Kim jesteśmy">​</a></h2>
<p>Jesteśmy 4-osobowym zespołem, który w większości pracuje asynchronicznie. Myśląc o pracy asynchronicznej, często skupiamy się na tym, że ktoś jest w innym miejscu na świecie i w innej strefie czasowej. Jednak nawet przebywanie w tej samej strefie czasowej nie gwarantuje pracy synchronicznej, ponieważ mamy różny tryb pracy, różne obowiązki prywatne oraz różne pory, w których możemy i chcemy pracować. Dodatkowo, dochodzi aspekt pracy zdalnej. W naszym przypadku 3 z 4 osób pracuje z domu. Dlatego przypadkowe interakcje między członkami naszego zespołu właściwie nie występują. Czasami zdarza się, że spotykamy się w biurze, ale jest to sytuacja sporadyczna i zazwyczaj jest podyktowana koniecznością wspólnej pracy nad jakimś zagadnieniem.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="z-czym-się-borykamy">Z czym się borykamy<a href="https://techwriter.pl/praca-w-zespole-rozproszonym#z-czym-si%C4%99-borykamy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Z czym się borykamy" title="Bezpośredni link do Z czym się borykamy">​</a></h2>
<p>Na początku wszystko wydawało się super, trochę taki miesiąc miodowy. Każdy pracował według własnych preferencji i dostępności. Praca szła do przodu, więc nie było większych powodów do zmartwień. Jednak z biegiem czasu zaczęliśmy zauważać pewne mniejsze i większe problemy, które negatywnie wpływały na naszą wydajność i osiąganie celów jako zespół.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="wiedza-zamknięta-w-głowach-poszczególnych-osób">Wiedza zamknięta w głowach poszczególnych osób<a href="https://techwriter.pl/praca-w-zespole-rozproszonym#wiedza-zamkni%C4%99ta-w-g%C5%82owach-poszczeg%C3%B3lnych-os%C3%B3b" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Wiedza zamknięta w głowach poszczególnych osób" title="Bezpośredni link do Wiedza zamknięta w głowach poszczególnych osób">​</a></h3>
<p>Problem stary jak świat, omawiany miliony razy. Wydawałoby się, że wszyscy wiedzą, że istnieje, więc powinni przeciwdziałać jego występowaniu. Niestety, tak nie jest i my też staliśmy się jego ofiarami. Z biegiem czasu, każdy z nas wyspecjalizował się w jakiejś dziedzinie. Jedna osoba jest ekspertem od DITY i wszelkich tematów z tym związanych. Inna jest specjalistą od infrastruktury, automatyzacji i deploymentu w chmurze. Jeszcze inne bardzo dobrze radzą sobie z technologiami frontendowymi. Dobrze jest mieć ekspertów w danej dziedzinie, ale powoduje to sytuacje, w których zadania z konkretnego zakresu zawsze trafiają do tych samych osób. Przez to w zespole mamy <em>single points of failure</em>. Jeśli dana osoba pójdzie na urlop albo nie ma czasu, praca stoi. Ktoś inny nie jest w stanie przejąć obowiązków i pociągnąć tematu ze względu na zbyt małą wiedzę.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="zbyt-mała-samowystarczalność-w-zakresie-lokalnego-środowiska-deweloperskiego">Zbyt mała samowystarczalność w zakresie lokalnego środowiska deweloperskiego<a href="https://techwriter.pl/praca-w-zespole-rozproszonym#zbyt-ma%C5%82a-samowystarczalno%C5%9B%C4%87-w-zakresie-lokalnego-%C5%9Brodowiska-deweloperskiego" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Zbyt mała samowystarczalność w zakresie lokalnego środowiska deweloperskiego" title="Bezpośredni link do Zbyt mała samowystarczalność w zakresie lokalnego środowiska deweloperskiego">​</a></h3>
<p>Nie wypracowaliśmy jeszcze całkowicie wytycznych i współdzielonych konfiguracji, które umożliwiałyby szybkie i sprawne rozwijanie i testowanie zmian lokalnie. Przez to tracimy czas na wspieranie siebie nawzajem, debugowanie problemów i wykrywanie różnic w konfiguracji narzędzi.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="spotkania">Spotkania<a href="https://techwriter.pl/praca-w-zespole-rozproszonym#spotkania" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Spotkania" title="Bezpośredni link do Spotkania">​</a></h3>
<p>Dobrze się rozmawia w miłym towarzystwie, ale nie taki jest cel organizowania spotkań. Zapewne każdy z nas brał udział w takich spotkaniach, podczas których miło się rozmawiało, ale nie wynikały z nich konkretne rzeczy do zrobienia. Po godzinnym spotkaniu, rozchodzimy się i nie mamy listy zadań do zrobienia oraz wspólnego zrozumienia tego, czym powinniśmy się zajmować w nadchodzącym tygodniu. Kolejny problem to tematy omawiane na spotkaniu. Są zagadnienia techniczne i biznesowe, które nie zawsze są istotne dla każdego.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="zbyt-rzadkie-i-zdawkowe-aktualizacje-dotyczące-wykonywanych-zadań">Zbyt rzadkie i zdawkowe aktualizacje dotyczące wykonywanych zadań<a href="https://techwriter.pl/praca-w-zespole-rozproszonym#zbyt-rzadkie-i-zdawkowe-aktualizacje-dotycz%C4%85ce-wykonywanych-zada%C5%84" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Zbyt rzadkie i zdawkowe aktualizacje dotyczące wykonywanych zadań" title="Bezpośredni link do Zbyt rzadkie i zdawkowe aktualizacje dotyczące wykonywanych zadań">​</a></h3>
<p>Niska częstotliwość aktualizacji zadań w systemie, niewystarczająca komunikacja z innymi członkami zespołu. W przypadku zespołów rozproszonych <em>overcommunication</em> jest kluczowe ze względu na brak możliwości zdobycia informacji przypadkowo, co ma miejsce w zespołach pracujących ze sobą na miejscu.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="co-robimy-żeby-było-lepiej">Co robimy, żeby było lepiej<a href="https://techwriter.pl/praca-w-zespole-rozproszonym#co-robimy-%C5%BCeby-by%C5%82o-lepiej" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Co robimy, żeby było lepiej" title="Bezpośredni link do Co robimy, żeby było lepiej">​</a></h2>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="odpowiedzialność-za-domenę-wiedzy">Odpowiedzialność za domenę wiedzy<a href="https://techwriter.pl/praca-w-zespole-rozproszonym#odpowiedzialno%C5%9B%C4%87-za-domen%C4%99-wiedzy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Odpowiedzialność za domenę wiedzy" title="Bezpośredni link do Odpowiedzialność za domenę wiedzy">​</a></h3>
<p>Za domenę wiedzy moglibyśmy uznać wspomniane wcześniej zagadnienia, takie jak infrastruktura, DITA, czy frontend. Jednak mogą to też być bardziej wyspecjalizowane sprawy, jak autentykacja, czy na przykład kontakty z zespołem, który zajmuje się globalizacją oprogramowania i dokumentacji. Takie domeny wykształcają się naturalnie z biegiem czasu pod wpływem krajobrazu zadań otaczających zespół, ale mają na nie wpływ także indywidualne preferencje poszczególnych osób oraz ich styl pracy. Jeżeli tylko jedna osoba jest odpowiedzialna za daną domenę, to kiedy jej nie ma, praca stoi. Jeżeli podczas jej nieobecności wydarzy się coś niespodziewanego to zespół jest w tarapatach.</p>
<p>Żeby zapobiegać tego typu problemom, ustaliliśmy pewne zasady związane z prowadzeniem domeny.</p>
<p>Po pierwsze, właściciel danej domeny jest odpowiedzialny za zadania z nią
związane. Jednak odpowiedzialność ta nie oznacza, że będzie on zajmował się sam wszystkimi zadaniami. Ma on się zaopiekować jedynie danym tematem od momentu zgłoszenia do rozwiązania. W zależności od sytuacji, może on podzielić zadanie na mniejsze, oddelegować je, dobrać się w parę z innym członkiem zespołu, itp. Po drugie, właściciel jest również odpowiedzialny za to, żeby mieć <em>backup</em>, który przejmie jego zadania podczas nieobecności. Dzięki temu każdy może wziąć urlop i w pełni się odłączyć od pracy nie martwiąc się, że w każdej chwili może zadzwonić telefon, albo że musi trzymać rękę na pulsie, bo ktoś gdzieś czeka na pomoc.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="dzielenie-się-wiedzą">Dzielenie się wiedzą<a href="https://techwriter.pl/praca-w-zespole-rozproszonym#dzielenie-si%C4%99-wiedz%C4%85" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Dzielenie się wiedzą" title="Bezpośredni link do Dzielenie się wiedzą">​</a></h3>
<p>Żeby móc efektywnie rozprowadzić odpowiedzialność po całym zespole, trzeba
dzielić się wiedzą. Wprowadziliśmy więc kilka zasad wokół tego tematu.</p>
<p>Jeśli ma to sens, podziel się informacją o rozwiązaniu problemu z innymi. Wykorzystaj do tego spotkanie zespołowe albo zakomunikuj to na piśmie, na przykład na Slacku albo w komentarzu pod rozwiązaną historyjką w Jirze.</p>
<p>To prowadzi nas do kolejnej zasady: zadbaj o dokumentację. Dobra dokumentacja to najlepsze źródło wiedzy, więc staraj się ją aktualizować na bieżąco. Kiedy to robisz, stosuj starą zasadę biwakowania: “Pozostaw to miejsce lepszym niż je zastałeś”. Poprawiaj i ulepszaj jak się tylko da. Prowadząc dokumentację, pamiętaj, żeby opisywać tematy przydatne dla innych. Znasz swoją publikę dość dobrze, jest to w końcu Twój zespół.</p>
<p>Przy okazji nauczyliśmy się, że robienie dobrych notatek w commitach i ticketach ułatwia późniejsze zrobienie dokumentacji.</p>
<p>Ostatnim filarem propagowania wiedzy jest dla nas praca w parach. Jeśli ma to sens, pracuj z inną osobą i staraj się to robić regularnie. Przy czym postaraj się popracować chociaż trochę z każdym.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="praca-asynchroniczna">Praca asynchroniczna<a href="https://techwriter.pl/praca-w-zespole-rozproszonym#praca-asynchroniczna" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Praca asynchroniczna" title="Bezpośredni link do Praca asynchroniczna">​</a></h3>
<p>Ja pracuję teraz, ale kolega poszedł pobiegać i będzie pracował po południu. Ktoś inny śpi, bo jest u niego noc, a koleżanka ma teraz akurat wizytę u lekarza. Nasza praca asynchroniczna doprowadziła do sformułowania całego szeregu zasad i prawideł.</p>
<p>Jeśli potrzebujesz odpowiedzi natychmiast, jasno o tym powiedz. Nie możesz oczekiwać od innych, że zajmą się Twoim pytaniem od razu.</p>
<p>Potrzebujesz, żeby inni sprawdzili Twoją pracę, ale nie chcesz też marnować ich czasu na znajdowanie oczywistych niedoróbek. Dlatego testuj lokalnie przed wystawieniem PRa.</p>
<p>Z drugiej strony, dziel się swoją pracą od razu, nie czekaj aż wszystko będzie idealne. Może Ci się wydawać, że opracowujesz magnum opus i potrzebujesz czasu.
Możesz się też wstydzić i obawiać krytyki ze strony innych. Jednak pamiętaj, że jesteście jednym zespołem i powinniście nauczyć się komunikować na tematy związane z pracą bez niepotrzebnych napięć. Nawet jeżeli nie prosisz od razu o review, opublikuj przynajmniej brancha, żeby inni mogli się do niego odwołać w razie potrzeby.</p>
<p>Żeby usprawnić komunikację wokół wspólnej pracy, korzystaj z możliwości jakie dają Ci narzędzia typu Bitbucket czy GitHub - pull requesty, komentarze, sugestie, itp. Ich dodatkową zaletą, oprócz komunikacji, jest to, że pozostawiają historię. Jeśli za kilka miesięcy będziesz mieć podobny problem, możesz się&nbsp;do niej odwołać, żeby przypomnieć sobie jak go rozwiązaliście.</p>
<p>Rób <em>review</em> zmian innych. Jest to istotny element dzielenia się wiedzą. Nawet jeśli zmiana została już zaakceptowana, przejrzyj ją, żeby dowiedzieć się co się wydarzyło.</p>
<p>Używaj systemu do zadań, żeby po Twojej pracy pozostał ślad. Dzięki temu inni będą wiedzieć czym się zajmujesz, a w przyszłości będzie można łatwo przypomnieć sobie, dlaczego dana zmiana została zrobiona.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="spotkania-1">Spotkania<a href="https://techwriter.pl/praca-w-zespole-rozproszonym#spotkania-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Spotkania" title="Bezpośredni link do Spotkania">​</a></h3>
<p>Mogłoby się wydawać, że w pracy asynchronicznej spotkania to samo dobro. Ale jedną z pierwszych zasad którą chcemy się tu podzielić to: jeśli spotkanie nie jest potrzebne, odwołaj je. Niepotrzebne spotkanie to strata czasu, który mógłbyś spędzić dużo lepiej.</p>
<p>Oczywiście spotkania są potrzebne, więc organizuj je i przychodź na te zorganizowane przez innych. Ale kiedy już na nich jesteś, skup się na rzeczach, które trzeba omówić. Pogawędka jest dobra na rozgrzewkę, ale potem trzeba trzymać dygresje w ryzach.</p>
<p>Żeby każde spotkanie było produktywne, zakończ je listą zadań i priorytetów na najbliższy czas. Każdy z uczestników musi wiedzieć czym ma się zajmować.</p>
<p>Jeśli spotkanie nie spełnia swojej roli, może warto je podzielić na dwa krótsze. Na przykład, jedno poświęcone technicznym zagadnieniom, a drugie poświęcone celom biznesowym. Wyobraź sobie, że planujecie skomplikowany projekt, ale nie możecie wyklarować pełnej wizji od początku do końca, bo na każdym kroku zaczynacie wnikać w szczegóły techniczne. Na pierwszym spotkaniu skup się tylko na wizji i ucinaj dyskusje o szczegółach. Kiedy już wszystkie etapy są zarysowane, poświęć następne spotkania na omówienie szczegółów każdego z nich.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="narzędzia">Narzędzia<a href="https://techwriter.pl/praca-w-zespole-rozproszonym#narz%C4%99dzia" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Narzędzia" title="Bezpośredni link do Narzędzia">​</a></h3>
<p>Narzędzia zawsze odgrywają rolę w pracy, a w pracy asynchronicznej mogą zrobić naprawdę dużą różnicę. Odkryliśmy kilka dobrych praktyk, które wiążą się ściśle z tym typem pracy.</p>
<p>Po pierwsze, testuj automatycznie co tylko się da. Dzięki temu można pracować szybciej, bez czekania na zatwierdzanie zmian przez innych.</p>
<p>Upewnij się, że każdy ma dobrze skonfigurowane lokalne środowisko do pracy. Dzięki temu wasze zmiany będą bardziej przewidywalne. Jeżeli u mnie coś działa, to powinno działać u koleżanki i powinno działać na środowisku produkcyjnym.</p>
<p>Jeżeli używasz formattera, np. Prettier, podziel się konfiguracją z całym zespołem i niech formatowanie będzie częścią commita. Wtedy przeglądanie zmian od innych będzie czytelniejsze, bo nie będzie zawierało przypadkowych elementów.</p>
<p>Korzystaj z komunikatorów, żeby informować na bieżąco innych nad czym pracujesz. Wyobraź sobie, że już kończysz pracę nad fantastyczną nową funkcjonalnością, a tu nagle ktoś wrzuca PR z tym samym. A mógłby pracować nad czymś innym, gdyby tylko wiedział.</p>
<p>Wykorzystuj narzędzia do organizacji pracy, takie jak Jira, i włącz opcje takie jak automatyczne przypisywanie zadań na podstawie domeny, automatyczne przypisywanie reviewerów, w zależności od nazwy brancha. Niby mała rzecz, ale w dłuższej perspektywie oszczędza czas.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="co-dalej">Co dalej?<a href="https://techwriter.pl/praca-w-zespole-rozproszonym#co-dalej" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Co dalej?" title="Bezpośredni link do Co dalej?">​</a></h2>
<p>Myślisz sobie: "My mamy podobny zespół i podobne trudności. Co powinniśmy robić?"</p>
<p>Każdy dobrze działający zespół jest podobny, ale każdy zespół z problemami jest inny. Nie mamy jednej recepty na uzdrowienie każdego z nich, ale wierzymy, że opis naszej drogi może posłużyć Wam za drogowskaz.</p>
<p>A więc co robimy?</p>
<p>Po pierwsze, robimy rachunek sumienia i opracowujemy plan działania. Dzielimy listę problemów na kawałki, które są strawne. Dzięki temu łatwiej nam będzie zacząć.</p>
<p>Po drugie, poszerzamy wiedzę w zakresie pracy w zespole, nie tylko rozproszonym. W tej kwestii mogą Wam się przydać następujące źródła:</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>20 marca MeetContentWRO ponownie gościł w inspirującym wnętrzu przy Szybowcowej 2, czyli w Nokia Garage.</p>
<p>Prezentację pod tytułem <em>"Smart search results with Natural Language Understanding (NLU)"</em> dostarczyło wspólnie trzech prelegentów z Nokii:</p>
<ul>
<li>Magdalena Jałówko, Product Owner</li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-kakol-14753b135/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam Kąkol</a>, Manager obszaru AI-Driven Knowledge Solutions</li>

<p>Nokia zajmuje się tworzeniem urządzeń do komunikacji, na przykład różnych urządzeń radiowych czy nadajników. W związku z tym potrzebuje udokumentować swoje produkty w sposób ustandaryzowany i umożliwiający tysiącom pracowników, klientów i użytkowników rozeznanie się w ogromie sprzętu.</p>
<p>NLU, czyli Natural Language Understanding, to obszar sztucznej inteligencji odpowiedzialny za interakcję między człowiekiem a komputerem, w szczególności za rozumienie i przetwarzanie języka naturalnego.</p>
<p>Nic dziwnego, że potrzebne było zaangażowanie nie-ludzkich 😉 zasobów, żeby to wszystko ogarnąć i uczynić ‘przyjaznym’ dla użytkownika.</p>
<p>Zespół Adama określił cel i przyjął pewne założenia.</p>
<p>Określono dwie istotne perspektywy rozumienia języka naturalnego:</p>
<ul>
<li>Użytkownika</li>
<li>Twórcy treści technicznych</li>
</ul>
<p>Cel z kolei był jasny: Poprawa wyników wyszukiwania w portalu dokumentacyjnym.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="intencje">Intencje<a href="https://techwriter.pl/meet-content-wro-marzec-2024-relacja#intencje" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Intencje" title="Bezpośredni link do Intencje">​</a></h2>
<p>Za każdym pytaniem (search query) czai się jakaś potrzeba użytkownika, tak zwana intencja.</p>
<p>Żeby tę intencję zidentyfikować, zespół Adama:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zorganizował serię wywiadów z użytkownikami</li>
<li>Przeanalizował wyszukiwane terminy</li>
</ul>
<p>Swoje odkrycia przetłumaczyli na strukturę grafową, zidentyfikowali tak zwane ‘named entities’ oraz relacje między nimi, a następnie stworzyli grafową bazę danych.</p>
<p>Czym zatem jest intencja? Okazuje się, że nieważne jak zadajemy nasze pytania, informacje, których tak naprawdę potrzebujemy da się sprowadzić do pewnych powtarzalnych kategorii.</p>
<p>Prosty przykład użyty przez naszych prelegentów to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Czy jutro będzie padać?</li>
<li>Czy jutro pogoda będzie dobra na piknik?</li>
<li>Temperatura jutro we Wrocławiu</li>
</ul>
<p>Wszystkie te zapytania dotyczą prognozy pogody. I to ona staje się intencją, która je łączy.</p>
<p>Każda intencja ma swoje parametry. Kontynuując przykład prognozy pogody, możemy wyodrębnić takie parametry jak lokalizacja czy data.</p>
<p>W Nokii zidentyfikowano 10 kluczowych intencji, które stały za zapytaniami użytkowników. Przykładowo, jeśli ktoś szukał informacji o wadze jakiegoś sprzętu, jego zapytanie było klasyfikowane jako intencja WYMIARY.</p>
<p>Często też użytkownicy chcieli porównać podobne sprzęty. Te zapytania były z kolei klasyfikowane jako PORÓWNANIE.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="grafowe-bazy-danych">Grafowe bazy danych<a href="https://techwriter.pl/meet-content-wro-marzec-2024-relacja#grafowe-bazy-danych" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Grafowe bazy danych" title="Bezpośredni link do Grafowe bazy danych">​</a></h2>
<p>Proste wyszukiwanie po tak zwanych słowach kluczowych nie radzi sobie z dużymi zestawami danych. Poza tym potrzebuje ścisłej i przewidywalnej struktury danych. Takie wymagania sprawiają, że wyszukiwanie staje się niewydajne i często nie generuje właściwych rezultatów.</p>
<p>Grafowe bazy danych przekładają dane na tak zwane wierzchołki (entities lub nodes). Wierzchołki mają swoje atrybuty (properties), które z kolei niosą kolejne informacje. Każdy wierzchołek może łączyć się z innym wierzchołkiem za pomocą relacji.</p>

<p>Semantyczny czyli znaczeniowy, a więc ‘semantic search’ to nic innego jak wyszukiwanie znaczeń, zamiast klasycznego dopasowania słów kluczowych. Dlaczego jest bardziej efektywne? Bo bierze pod uwagę kontekst i znaczenie słów.</p>

<p>W Nokii dokonano obróbki dokumentacji produktowej w taki sposób, że każdy dokument został zaanotowany tagami XML. To pozwoliło na sprzęgnięcie wszystkich elementów: zidentyfikowanie wierzchołków, ich atrybutów i wartości oraz relacji.</p>
<p>Powstała baza danych, która pozwala użytkownikom precyzyjnie przeszukiwać zasoby i sprawniej manipulować danymi, zgodnie z intencją zapytania.</p>

<p>Jak się domyślacie, trzeba było ten skomplikowany kłębek połączeń przedstawić użytkownikowi w sposób zrozumiały i przejrzysty.  Znowu potrzebne były wywiady z użytkownikami a rezultat to przyjazny interfejs, który w prosty sposób pozwala nawigować poprzez kompleksowość produktów Nokii. Czego byliśmy świadkami podczas demo 🤩</p>

<p>Po prezentacji, uczestnicy mieli kilka pytań.</p>
<p>Szczególnie interesowała ich kwestia aktualizowania bazy danych. Okazuje się, że w grafowej bazie danych informacje są zawsze aktualne, bo są powiązane bezpośrednio ze źródłem. Jeśli źródło zostało zaktualizowane, ten stan będzie odzwierciedlony w wynikach wyszukiwania.</p>
<p>Kolejną kwestią był dostęp do treści, czyli kto powinien widzieć co i jak tym sterować?</p>
<p>Otóż grafowe bazy danych umożliwiają różne poziomy dostępu. Po otrzymaniu zapytania, baza danych identyfikuje poziom dostępu pytającego i pokazuje mu TYLKO te wierzchołki, do których pytający ma dostęp.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Prezentujemy listę konferencji, które mogą być interesujące dla specjalistów z branży
komunikacji technicznej w 2024.</p>
<p>W tym roku postanowiliśmy podejść do tematu bardziej praktycznie. Zamiast kompilować listę
wszystkich wydarzeń, które udało nam się&nbsp;znaleźć, wybraliśmy tylko takie,
które odbywają się blisko Polski i takie, które oferują opcję dołączenia
wirtualnie. Na odległych kontynentach dzieją się ciekawe rzeczy, ale raczej
mało kto z nas będzie potrafił przekonać swojego przełożonego do udziału
w takim wydarzeniu :) Mamy nadzieję, że ta formuła będzie dla Was bardziej
przydatna. Dajcie nam znać co myślicie w komentarzach.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="po-co-tworzyć-filmy-produktowe">Po co tworzyć filmy produktowe?<a href="https://techwriter.pl/meet-content-wro-luty-2024-relacja#po-co-tworzy%C4%87-filmy-produktowe" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Po co tworzyć filmy produktowe?" title="Bezpośredni link do Po co tworzyć filmy produktowe?">​</a></h2>
<p>Ekipa z CodeTwo zaczęła od podstaw - czyli od <em>dlaczego</em>.</p>
<p>Otóż okazuje się, że treści video są wyżej indeksowane przez wyszukiwarki, a więc mają większą szansę pojawić się w wynikach wyszukiwania niż treści pisane. Ponadto, wszyscy wiemy, że coraz mniej ludzi chce czytać i jeśli ma do wyboru filmik lub manual, wybiorą filmik.</p>
<p>Video produktowe pomagają również w marketingu firmy, promocji produktu i danej funkcjonalności.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="o-czym-robić-filmiki-produktowe">O czym robić filmiki produktowe?<a href="https://techwriter.pl/meet-content-wro-luty-2024-relacja#o-czym-robi%C4%87-filmiki-produktowe" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do O czym robić filmiki produktowe?" title="Bezpośredni link do O czym robić filmiki produktowe?">​</a></h3>
<p>Jak już zdecydujemy, że chcemy je robić, trzeba zastanowić się i wybrać, jakie funkcjonalności najlepiej w tych filmikach pokazać.</p>
<p>W CodeTwo filmowe scenariusze przychodzą z wielu miejsc - z nowymi wydaniami programów na czele. Inspiracji dostarcza również zespół Customer Success, będący najbliżej klientów i dobrze znający ich potrzeby. Swoje sugestie daje też zespół Technical Marketingu podczas cyklicznych burz mózgów, oraz sam CEO.</p>

<p>Od czego zacząć realizację filmiku?</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="koncept-skrypt-i-weryfikacja">Koncept, skrypt i weryfikacja<a href="https://techwriter.pl/meet-content-wro-luty-2024-relacja#koncept-skrypt-i-weryfikacja" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Koncept, skrypt i weryfikacja" title="Bezpośredni link do Koncept, skrypt i weryfikacja">​</a></h3>
<p>Jeśli chcemy, aby nasze video wyglądało profesjonalnie, trzeba się odpowiednio przygotować. W CodeTwo zaczynają od napisania skryptu, propozycji tytułu i ustalenia, które elementy UI będą brały udział w instrukcji video.</p>
<p>Następnie przychodzi czas na weryfikację skryptu pod kątem poprawności językowej i odpowiedniego przygotowania środowiska, czyli dostosowania rozdzielczości i formatu, ale i stworzenie przykładowych danych i użytkowników. Nie chcemy przecież pokazywać przypadkowych danych na środowisku testowym w stylu: “jakiś klient 123” (albo gorzej 😀).</p>
<p>Potem nagrywana jest kopia robocza. Tu padła bardzo praktyczna rada: przed nagrywaniem akcji na swoim pulpicie, wyłącz notyfikacje 😅</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="planowanie-warstwy-graficznej">Planowanie warstwy graficznej<a href="https://techwriter.pl/meet-content-wro-luty-2024-relacja#planowanie-warstwy-graficznej" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Planowanie warstwy graficznej" title="Bezpośredni link do Planowanie warstwy graficznej">​</a></h3>
<p>Trzeba też zdecydować, czy chcemy pokazywać osobę mówiącą o produkcie i funkcjonalności czy tylko interfejs, no i oczywiście w jakiej formie będzie pokazywany ten interfejs: na dole ekranu, po prawej, etc? Koniecznie trzeba obliczyć, ile czasu każdy ekran pokazywać, jak długi powinien być narzut czasowy, żeby użytkownik próbujący odtworzyć akcje na swojej maszynie, mógł się odnaleźć.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="nagrywanie">Nagrywanie<a href="https://techwriter.pl/meet-content-wro-luty-2024-relacja#nagrywanie" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Nagrywanie" title="Bezpośredni link do Nagrywanie">​</a></h3>
<p>CodeTwo postawiło na zbudowanie małego studia nagrań u siebie w biurze. Ich CEO, Szymon Szczęśniak, podkłada głos do większości ich filmików, co daje też element budowania zaufania do marki. Czego nie da się osiągnąć, na przykład, zlecając nagrania firmie zewnętrznej.</p>
<p>Oczywiście, sama realizacja wymaga sporej liczby powtórzeń, ale według prelegentów, im lepiej wykonane są czynności przygotowawcze, tym mniejsza jest liczba prób.</p>
<p>Bardzo ważna jest precyzyjna synchronizacja głosu lektora z tym, co dzieje się na interfejsie. Trzeba też usunąć wszelkie głębsze wdechy, mlaśnięcia, czy przejeżdżającą obok karetkę na sygnale 😉</p>
<p>Mając na uwadze różne formaty, w których użytkownicy mogą chcieć odtwarzać filmiki, warto nagrywać video w wersji poziomej oraz dodatkowo w wersji pionowej, na potrzeby urządzeń mobilnych i reels na Instagramie i YouTube.
Trzeba też pomyśleć o wybraniu thumbnails, pod kątem korzystności kadru i spójności z marką i innymi treściami na stronie.</p>
<p>Narzędzi do tworzenia video i nagrywania UI jest wiele. Popularne są np. Camtasia i Adobe After Effects.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="montaż-filmu-i-przygotowanie-do-publikacji">Montaż filmu i przygotowanie do publikacji<a href="https://techwriter.pl/meet-content-wro-luty-2024-relacja#monta%C5%BC-filmu-i-przygotowanie-do-publikacji" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Montaż filmu i przygotowanie do publikacji" title="Bezpośredni link do Montaż filmu i przygotowanie do publikacji">​</a></h3>
<p>To kolejny krok na długiej drodze do publikacji dwuminutowego video 😉
Filmiki produktowe w CodeTwo uploadowane są bezpośrednio na YouTube, a następnie są embedowane na ich własnej stronie.</p>
<p>Na tym etapie dodawane są też napisy, do czego CodeTwo używa Happy Scribe.
Dodawane są również timestamps, które pozwalają odesłać użytkownika do konkretnego momentu w video.</p>
<p>Jeśli myśleliście, że to już koniec - no to nie tak szybko! 😆</p>
<p>Trzeba jeszcze zbudować flow, tak zwany user journey, czyli jeśli obejrzałeś filmik A, to teraz logicznie będzie, jeśli zasugerujemy ci filmik B.</p>
<p>Teraz można publikować! 🤩 🥁</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="pytania-uczestników">Pytania uczestników<a href="https://techwriter.pl/meet-content-wro-luty-2024-relacja#pytania-uczestnik%C3%B3w" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Pytania uczestników" title="Bezpośredni link do Pytania uczestników">​</a></h2>
<p>Jak możecie podejrzewać, po prezentacji pojawiło się mnóstwo pytań.</p>
<p>Najbardziej chyba nurtującym problemem było: co zrobić, kiedy pojawiają się jakieś zmiany w interfejsie i film traci na aktualności?</p>
<p>CodeTwo radzi, aby dzielić filmiki na sekcje i tworzyć playlistę z małych fragmentów, co pozwala na łatwiejsze podmienianie treści w razie zmian.</p>
<p>Również po prezentacji temat cieszył się ciągłym zainteresowaniem, bo kiedy już pałaszowaliśmy pyszne bruschetty, padały dodatkowe pytania. Wielu uczestników wspominało, że w ich pracy też nagrywają lub zamierzają nagrywać filmili produktowe.</p>
<hr>
<p>Serdecznie dziękujemy zarówno CodeTwo za bycie wspaniałym gospodarzem, jak i wszystkim uczestnikom 🙌</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Jeśli jesteś Tech Writerem wystarczająco długo, z pewnością jest dla ciebie jasne, że nie wiedzieć czemu pozostajemy nieco w cieniu 🤔</p>
<p>Dlatego dziś będzie o wychodzeniu z cienia.</p>
<p>Temat podniosła nie tak dawno temu <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicoletells/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicole Alexandra Michaelis</a>, w swoim poście <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/why-i-no-longer-believe-in-content-design-e71aeb5f060c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Why I no longer believe in Content design</a>. Nicole rozwija swoją myśl dalej w podcaście <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2i6rIMP8ZIeMNbABzwIpx7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Content rookie</a>.</p>
<p>Temat samotności i niezrozumienia roli contentowca mocno wybrzmiewał również podczas zeszłorocznej konferencji Soap.</p>
<p>Podczas jednego z lightning boxów, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cynthiapeter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cynthia Peter</a> wystąpiła z rewolucyjną wręcz odezwą do wszystkich zgromadzonych, abyśmy wzięli sprawy w swoje ręce i zaczęli się wreszcie promować. Takie zawołanie widocznie zelektryzowało publiczność. Wszyscy zgadzali się, że czas już najwyższy i potrzeba jest paląca 🔥</p>
<p>Cynthia jako rozwiązanie sugerowała udział w konferencjach developerskich, żeby przybliżyć naszą pracę temu środowisku. I takie inicjatywy są z całą pewnością słuszne.</p>
<p>Wymagają one jednak:</p>
<ul>
<li>dostania się na taką konferencję</li>
<li>umiejętności speakerskich</li>
<li>wysokiej odporności na stres</li>
</ul>
<p>Jeśli więc nie czujemy się całkowicie pewnie na scenie w sali wypełnionej programistami, nie traćmy nadziei! 😉</p>
<p>Możemy zacząć wdrażać zmianę w mniejszej skali, powiedzmy na poziomie firmy, w której pracujemy.</p>
<p>Jak? Na to być może każdy z nas ma jakieś swoje metody. Ja opowiem wam o swoich.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="demo">Demo<a href="https://techwriter.pl/jak-podnie%C5%9B%C4%87-visibility-tech-commsow#demo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Demo" title="Bezpośredni link do Demo">​</a></h2>
<p>Jeśli pracujesz w IT, jest duża szansa, że zespoły z którymi współpracujesz organizują sesję Demo, gdzie pokazują co udało im się zbudować przez jakiś okres czasu, sprint, kwartał, etc.</p>
<p>Możesz poprosić osoby prezentujące żeby dołączyły slajd z linkami do miejsc gdzie funkcjonalność, o której będzie mowa jest udokumentowana. Najlepiej jednak sam stwórz taki slajd, żeby maksymalnie ułatwić sprawę dla prezentera.</p>
<p>A skoro to Demo, dorzuć też jakiś zrzut ekranu z dokumentacji, żeby nie pokazać samych linków, ale zaprezentować się bardziej wizualnie. Na przykład, zrób zrzut nagłówka i pierwszych dwóch paragrafów. Możesz dodać też swoje zdjęcie, a co! 😉</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="podziękowania">Podziękowania<a href="https://techwriter.pl/jak-podnie%C5%9B%C4%87-visibility-tech-commsow#podzi%C4%99kowania" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Podziękowania" title="Bezpośredni link do Podziękowania">​</a></h3>
<p>Zazwyczaj osoba prezentująca na Demo nie będzie miała nic przeciwko. Co więcej, z czym spotykam się bardzo często, podczas samej prezentacji, Tech Writer który udokumentował funkcjonalność jest wspomniany razem z ogólnym podziękowaniem za dobrą współpracę 🙂</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="podsumowanie-kwartału">Podsumowanie kwartału<a href="https://techwriter.pl/jak-podnie%C5%9B%C4%87-visibility-tech-commsow#podsumowanie-kwarta%C5%82u" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Podsumowanie kwartału" title="Bezpośredni link do Podsumowanie kwartału">​</a></h2>
<p>W zależności w jakich interwałach czasowych funkcjonuje twoja firma, możesz też zapoczątkować wysyłanie maili z aktualnościami z twojego działu. Klasycznie, rzeczy, które warto podkreślić to między innymi:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wdrożone funkcjonalności, które twój dział dokumentował wraz z linkami do tej dokumentacji, jeśli ktoś chciałby poczytać więcej.</li>
<li>Nowi Tech Writerzy dołączający do zespołu.</li>
<li>Linki do ciekawie zrobionych i ogólnodostępnych portali dokumentacyjnych innych firm.</li>

<p>Znajdź sposób, żeby przedstawić swoją pracę w liczbach. Na przykład:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ile funkcjonalności udokumentowałeś w danym przedziale czasowym? (uśrednij, policz zamknięte taski)</li>
<li>Z iloma SMEs musiałeś się skontaktować, żeby w pełni zrozumieć i opisać nową funkcjonalność?</li>
<li>Ile bugów dokumentacyjnych udało ci się rozwiązać?</li>
</ul>
<p>A najlepiej, jeśli przedstawisz to w jakimś zgrabnym pie charcie! 🤩</p>

<p>Używaj ogólnych kanałów, gdzie gromadzą się produktowcy czy programiści z obszaru którym się zajmujesz. Publikuj tam zwięzłe opowieści o twojej pracy i warsztacie.</p>

<p>Przypuśćmy, że zespół poprosił cię o wymyślenie nazwy dla nowego atrybutu. Możesz krótko opisać co robisz, żeby na końcu powstała krótka lista z sugestiami.</p>
<p>To jest nie lada wyzwanie i jako takie powinieneś to opisać! Są trudy i przeciwności i świat musi o tym usłyszeć. Każdy nowy pomysł ma wady i zalety.</p>
<p>Możesz opisać na przykład:</p>
<ul>
<li>Czy robisz burzę mózgów? Jeśli tak, to solo czy prosisz o udział innych Tech Writerów?</li>
<li>Jakich kryteriów potem używasz robiąc selekcję?</li>
<li>Czy używasz jakichś narzędzi?</li>
<li>Czy masz ulubiony Thesaurus?</li>
</ul>
<p>Możesz też podlinkować ogólnodostępne wytyczne i dobre praktyki z dziedziny UX copy lub  poprosić o ocenę trzech wersji jednego komunikatu błędu. Niech zagłosują który podoba im się bardziej.</p>

<p>Kiedy ktoś publikuje post o funkcjonalności, którą opisywałeś ty lub ktoś z twojego zespołu, na przykład, że właśnie wydali jakąś konkretną zmianę, w tym samym wątku wklej link do dokumentacji.</p>
<p>Opatrz go oczywiście odpowiednim intro: <em>Hej, w razie gdybyście potrzebowali więcej informacji, dokumentację która jest już dostępna dla klienta możesz znaleźć pod TYM LINKIEM. Feedback mile widziany!</em></p>
<p>Chwalmy się tym co robimy!</p>

<p>Nagraj filmik opisujący proces tworzenia dokumentacji. Innym razem opowiedz o narzędziach, których używacie. Pokaż różnie smaczki, które twój CMS umożliwia.</p>
<p>A może macie skomplikowany proces publikowania treści? Kto wie, może jakiś programista znajdzie trochę czasu żeby pomóc ci co nieco usprawnić? 🤔</p>
<p>Postuj to wszystko na jakimś kanale przeznaczonym do dzielenia się wiedzą, jeśli taki istnieje.</p>

<p>Jak ze wszystkim w życiu, jest pewna granica. Wszyscy dobrze wiemy, że właściwie każdy Tech Writer ma masę roboty, żeby nadążyć za developmentem. Nie wspominając o dodatkowym wysiłku poświęconym na promocję swojej pracy.</p>
<p>I to jest całkowicie zrozumiałe.</p>
<p>Jeśli czujesz się na siłach, możesz zacząć od małych zmian, zaplanować je i zbierać materiał w tak zwanym między czasie, na przykład w trakcie kwartału.</p>

<p>A tak poważnie, jeśli tylko mamy możliwość, przypominajmy sobie od czasu do czasu, że nasza praca nie polega tylko na zamykaniu tasków.</p>
<p>Pielęgnujmy w sobie pasję do efektywnej komunikacji! 💪</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-journey">The Journey<a href="https://techwriter.pl/context-sensitive-help#the-journey" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do The Journey" title="Bezpośredni link do The Journey">​</a></h2>
<p>I have been a developer for more than 20 years and a technical writer for even
longer. One of the first commercial software applications I built was a mobile
airline booking, payment, and travel management app. To create a viable mobile
help system required me to design on-screen real-time help, focused on the
specific task a user was performing. This included tooltips for each task and
each screen element. With limited screen real estate and limited device memory,
tooltips had to be hyper focused and effective. My journey into context
sensitive help (CSH) had begun.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="evolution">Evolution<a href="https://techwriter.pl/context-sensitive-help#evolution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Evolution" title="Bezpośredni link do Evolution">​</a></h2>
<p>Since my early developer years, the mobile landscape has evolved into the
predominant software platform for consumers. A similar pace of evolution has not
fully materialized for online help systems. While documentation has generally
become more structured, there is still a void when considering instant, focused,
effective context sensitive help (CSH). Current help systems still rely
predominantly on linked PDF help files, online web help systems, and indexed
document searches. Organizations use these help systems to manage large volumes
of documentation and multiple systems and versions.</p>
<p>To be sure, there are noticeable advancements in structured, versioned, and
indexed help systems. GitHub, DITA, and service portals contribute to these
structured improvements. Yet, progress with real-time, in-place, targeted CSH
has not reached its full potential. CSH embraces a new focus on designing and
delivering help systems targeted to customer ease with finding the exact help
needed at the exact time needed. This represents a paradigm shift from an
organization-managed cost-based focus to a customer-centric focus. Not an easy
journey for most organizations, but a necessary journey, nonetheless.</p>
<p>Let’s compare two cases in terms of CSH. The first case is without CSH and the
second case is with CSH. Both cases are real.</p>
<p>The case without CSH is an existing online banking payment portal (no brands or
personal details). A short follow-up analysis and solution are presented after
the case example.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="case-1-payment-portal--without-csh">Case #1 Payment Portal — without CSH<a href="https://techwriter.pl/context-sensitive-help#case-1-payment-portal--without-csh" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Case #1 Payment Portal — without CSH" title="Bezpośredni link do Case #1 Payment Portal — without CSH">​</a></h2>
<p>The bank payment portal has the following data fields:</p>
<ol>
<li>Entity (with a drop-down list of previous recipients, if any)</li>
<li>Reference</li>
<li>Amount</li>
<li>Schedule Payment</li>

<p>None of the above fields indicate if they are required or not (see screen
capture – no bank or personal information is included, only a sample of the
online form). The submit button is disabled until each is filled.</p>
<p>None of the data fields have any CSH nor help icons nor auto text suggestions,
nor any help at all. When you cursor out of a field, if you have not properly
completed the field, you receive a warning message to complete the field before
proceeding. There are no further instructions on how to complete the field.
There are no samples nor images of what a reference or entity field looks like.
To receive help, you have to click a help icon at the top of the bank web page.
This link forces you to leave your current page and open a chat AI. If you are
not fluent in the bank’s default language, your help request results are likely
to be unhelpful. If the help AI cannot understand or find a help topic for your
request, the help AI will direct you to a human if you are within the support
desk working hours. In my case, my default language is English. My bank’s
default language is not English, so my search for help returned no results.
Additionally, I was outside the window of human support. Result: I could not
complete my transaction.</p>

<p>The lack of help can result in a high probability of transaction failure. This
creates frustration for the customer and negative perceptions of the Bank. Also,
transferring the customer to a human assistant at this point in the transaction
process is time-consuming, unnecessary, and costly for the Bank. Customer
satisfaction and retention may be jeopardized.</p>

<p>This payment application could be cost-effectively improved by including the
following simple CSH for each data field.</p>
<ol>
<li>Entity – include a tooltip that shows what the required entity data looks
like with a sample from an invoice or bill showing the entity field.</li>
<li>Reference – include a tooltip that shows what the reference data looks like
with a sample from an invoice or bill showing the reference field.</li>
<li>Amount – include a tooltip showing the format for entering payment currency.</li>
<li>Schedule Payment – include an explanation about time frames for scheduling.
If a schedule is not required, explain the default payment time-frame.</li>
<li>Submit Button – include a roll-over tooltip explanation for required data
before payment submission is allowed.</li>

<p>In the following example, I was tasked with creating a technical report about
COVID Lambda variant dynamics in Peru. My report included extensive and
customizable data graphs and data tables that required explanation for
interpretation and use. Instead of creating a separate help file for the report,
I decided to use the existing CSH for each data entity I had already created,
and then allow the user to create an on-demand help document. This way, if a
user was interested in a particular data set in the report, they could get
instant help for their interest, instead of the traditional help document search
method. Visit the link below to see how I built this CSH project.</p>
<p>View the Technical Report on my page here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.graphcube.com/cf/News/COVIDPeru.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.graphcube.com/cf/News/COVIDPeru.php</a></p>
<p>On the report page, try the following:</p>
<ul>

<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> I created a series of tooltips using JavaScript. These
tooltips are displayed when a user performs an <code>onMouseOver</code> event for a help
icon. Each tooltip is assigned a unique and sequential ID value. For example, my
tooltip IDs start at ‘CSD0000’. Numbering is unimportant, but the prefix ‘CSD’
(or anything you choose) will be used to collect all your <code>onMouseOver</code> content
later.</p>
<p><strong>Optional Header:</strong> You can create a DIV tag with an <code>onMouseOver</code>
introduction/title content or any other desired content. You can choose to
display this content or not (style display attribute). For this example, I
included a title, author, and a basic description of the report. I selected not
to display this header in my Report, rather, I used this content for the
Introduction section of the on-demand Help Document.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> For each graph or data table, I created a JavaScript <code>onMouseOver</code>
tooltip with very minimal HTML formatting (see example Code Box 1 – this is the
CSH for Chart #1 in the example document).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="A screen shot of a computer screen" src="https://techwriter.pl/assets/images/codebox1-8dd291e7f3aa4a6bc2de3d66aff18109.png" width="624" height="251" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> The tooltips created in Step 1 were wrapped inside a div container
with the sequential id value, as explained in the Prerequisite section above.
The style object display property of the tooltip div is initially set to none.
The <code>onMouseOver</code> event triggers the display property to block (visible), the
<code>onMouseOut</code> even returns the display property to none. This is the CSH element.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Keeping the CSH inline with the code tightly couples the help with
the original code, facilitating versioning and editing.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> At the end of the document, I created an <code>onClick</code> button and a
simple JavaScript function (see Code Box 2) that finds all elements with div id
matching “CSD”. The <code>onMouseOver</code> content from each collected element is stored
as an array variable. Essentially, the function is extracting all the content
from the <code>onMouseOver</code> events and writing this content to a variable. Minimal
parsing removes the <code>onMouseOver</code> function opening bracket - (‘- and replaces
the closing bracket -‘)- with an HTML &lt;hr&gt; element, purely for readability.
All HTML code and style elements within the <code>onMouseOver</code> content are
interpreted as HTML.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> The <code>onClick</code> button event writes the content from the collection
variable to a new HTML tab, essentially creating an on-demand help file. This
tab can be printed or saved.</p>
<p><strong>Optional Footer:</strong> Similar to the header, you can create a footer for your
document in an <code>onMouseOver</code> event. For this report, I included basic
references.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="technical-report-example-wrap-up">Technical Report Example Wrap-Up<a href="https://techwriter.pl/context-sensitive-help#technical-report-example-wrap-up" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Technical Report Example Wrap-Up" title="Bezpośredni link do Technical Report Example Wrap-Up">​</a></h3>
<p>Obvious advantages of this CSH approach include a tight coupling of the
application with the help content, versioning control in-sync with application
versioning, and on-demand documentation generation. This approach is code
agnostic and can be implemented in any developer language (python, PHP, Java,
etc.). JavaScript events can be changed to other objects that fit developer and
customer requirements. For larger applications, greater customization and code
optimization can be achieved by creating CSH references to external JSON, XML,
text, or database generated help content.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="planning-a-csh-project">Planning a CSH Project<a href="https://techwriter.pl/context-sensitive-help#planning-a-csh-project" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Planning a CSH Project" title="Bezpośredni link do Planning a CSH Project">​</a></h2>
<p>Planning and creating a CSH project can be a straightforward process. Key
considerations include which applications are best suited for short, targeted
task-based CSH and which applications or systems require more extensive help.
Task-based user actions such as configuration, installation, data entry and form
completion are good candidates for CSH. Descriptive, product, and marketing
documents (little or no direct user action) may not be the best projects for
CSH. In many cases, extensive help documentation can be enhanced by short,
focused, and targeted CSH. I like to think of extensive help documents similar
to coding principles: compartmentalizing code based on a discrete function
performed by the code. The same thought process can be applied to CSH. CSH
implementation is flexible and can fit into common language platforms including
JavaScript, PHP, Python, C, Java, etc.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="csh-future">CSH Future<a href="https://techwriter.pl/context-sensitive-help#csh-future" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do CSH Future" title="Bezpośredni link do CSH Future">​</a></h2>
<p>Eventually, applications will require CSH for use by AI to generate predictive
and responsive help targeted to user behavior. CSH represents discreet, focused
help content that can be used for effective customer metrics. Customer use
patterns and bottlenecks are rapidly identified and can be discretely addressed.
Given the component nature of CSH, complex or frequently used help components
could be easily bookmarked by customers in an on-demand virtual notebook for
easy access. Imagine a complex configuration setting or complex task for an
application, which could be bookmarked, and then called up from a real-time
onscreen one-click bookmark. Instead of application-centric and help-centric
separate approaches, CSH becomes integrated with application functionality in a
unified object that better serves the end user.</p>]]></content>

<p>Thank you for getting in touch, Andrzej! I'm truly honored to have the
opportunity to share my insights and expertise with your readers.</p>
<p>So, my name is Oksana, and many of my friends and colleagues call me Oksi. I am
a seasoned content professional who is passionate about crafting experiences
with words (and visual storytelling). I am currently open to new opportunities.
With over 9 years of hands-on experience in technical writing, content
marketing, product marketing, and UX writing, I am excited about translating
complex tech solutions into easily understandable text.</p>
<p>My hobbies encompass a wide range of activities, including crafting handmade
items, creating digital illustrations, and I have recently started learning how
to play the piano.</p>

<p>I hold a Master's degree in Translation Studies and Contrastive Linguistics,
with a focus on English as my major and German as my secondary language. My
lifelong passion for the English language led me down a career path I hadn't
even realized was possible. I entered the field of IT while still a student,
and, truth be told, it was a mere coincidence.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-how-did-you-get-into-technical-writing">3.

How did you get into technical writing?" title="Bezpośredni link do 3. How did you get into technical writing?">​</a></h3>
<p>Initially, I began my career as a Copywriter in the marketing department, but I
soon found that I struggled to cope with the demands of the IT field due to my
lack of prior experience. As a result, I began to explore new opportunities
within the company. Fortunately, I came across an internship opening within the
Technical Communication Office department, which I eagerly accepted.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4-what-kinds-of-documentation-you-produced-and-what-did-you-specialize-in">4.

<p>I 've had the pleasure of being involved in a diverse range of content assets
creation, spanning from highly technical tasks such as: crafting API guides,
release notes, and developer's documentation, to the creation and customization
of online help systems from scratch.</p>
<p>Additionally, I've taken on tasks like producing how-to guides and promotional
videos, editing and creating presentations, crafting one pagers and success
stories with a strong tech focus. I introduced a creative approach to developing
animated videos and subsequently shared my expertise with the entire department.</p>
<p>This initiative elevated the demand for this format internally, bringing a new
dimension to the kind of requests we began to receive. As you can see, the realm
of technical writing encompasses a broad spectrum of content outputs, and it
also leaves some room for creativity.</p>

<p>After 5 years of successfully climbing the career ladder and establishing myself
as an expert in the technical writing domain, I began to experience a sense of
monotony.</p>
<p>While I have a genuine passion for delving deep into the technical intricacies
of how products operate. There were times when developers teased me for being
able to read the entire code without having to ask them about specific code
snippets or comments.</p>
<p>It was during this time that I realized my creative side was not being fully
expressed. I was eager to explore new opportunities for personal and
professional growth in different domains, and I considered marketing to be a
perfect fit.</p>

<p>My colleagues in the Technical Communication Office were truly exceptional, and
I not only acquired a wealth of knowledge but also formed lasting friendships.</p>
<p>Through this experience, I developed a deep understanding of the software
development process, how products operate, and their creation, which has proven
invaluable in my collaboration with subject matter experts.</p>
<p>I also really loved this amazing corporate culture. This led me to the decision
to remain within the company and return to the marketing department as a Service
Marketing Lead.</p>

<p>I want to emphasize that the technical writing skills I acquired through my time
in the Technical Communication Office at SoftServe are of exceptionally high
quality. I am profoundly grateful to this department for the numerous growth and
learning opportunities it provided.</p>
<p>It was like wearing multiple hats, and this experience allowed me to grow from
various professional perspectives. I seized every chance to expand my skill set,
and I would like to highlight some of the significant areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Project Management:</strong> Working within software development teams gave me a
deep understanding of Agile processes. I led technical writing projects,
mentored junior writers, and consistently met deadlines, which proved
invaluable in the dynamic marketing landscape with shifting priorities,
evolving requirements, and seamless cross-team collaboration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Communicating with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)</strong>: Crafting marketing
assets that convey technical information effectively requires the ability to
ask concise questions, grasp product intricacies, and understand their
business value across diverse applications.</p>
<p>Thanks to my extensive involvement in software development projects and
interactions with product managers, technical leads, and architects, I've
gained experience in presenting information for both general and technically
savvy audiences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Writing in technical and marketing contexts has its unique</strong> <strong>challenges</strong>.
In technical writing, it requires concise and precise wording, adherence to
style guides, and simple sentence construction. Marketing writing shares
similarities, including brevity, data-backed information, and adherence to
style guides for a consistent organizational voice, tone, and terminology.
Simplicity and clarity are essential in both.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the key difference lies in the diverse array of assets at your disposal
in marketing. You have the freedom to choose the most fitting format, whether
it's an interactive infographic, an ebook, a white paper, or a demonstration
page, allowing ample room for creative expression.</p>

<p>I can't think of a better definition than the one provided by Yasmeen Turayhi, a
Product Marketing Executive, Award-Winning Film Writer, and author of
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breaking-into-Product-Marketing-Interview/dp/B0B2N4ZXVN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Breaking into Product Marketing</a>.
In her book, she offers the following definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The primary goal of product marketing is to deliver the right product to the
target customer at the right time to ensure customer adoption."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sound familiar? Well, here's the definition of a technical writer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A technical writer is a user's advocate responsible for delivering the right
content to the right audience at the right time."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both definitions share the common goal of delivering value. However, the core
objectives of a product marketing manager encompass market validation,
positioning, packaging, go-to-market strategies, and overall marketing strategy.</p>

<p>I vividly recall a conversation I had with one of the CMOs when I re-entered the
world of marketing. We discussed how to become a professional marketer, and I
admitted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I still have a lot to learn."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He responded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In my 20 years of journey, I'm still learning. It's a continuous and exciting
path that constantly offers new perspectives. Experience is the lifelong
degree you'll attain."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is how I perceive it.</p>

<p>I want to emphasize the crucial role of a product marketing manager as a key
liaison connecting various teams within an organization. They act as a bridge
between the sales, product development, and marketing teams. This position
necessitates a deep understanding of the product, enabling effective
communication of its value, features, and benefits to both internal and external
stakeholders.</p>
<p>From my personal experience, I initially held the role of a Service Marketing
Lead, where I focused on promoting the company's services. Later, I transitioned
to the role of Content Marketing Manager, responsible for content creation.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="12-what-kind-of-mindset-do-you-need-to-succeed-in-this-field">12. What kind of mindset do you need to succeed in this field?<a href="https://techwriter.pl/kilka-pytan-do-czesc-30-marketing#12-what-kind-of-mindset-do-you-need-to-succeed-in-this-field" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do 12.

<p>I believe the key is to maintain a flexible and novice's mindset. Embracing
flexibility fosters creative ideas and "thinking outside the box." It's
essential to step back, observe your own product, and experience it as a user to
grasp its value and benefits fully.</p>
<p>Consistently adopting a novice's mindset provides a fresh, unattached
perspective. It allows you to ask simple questions others might miss and
generate innovative ideas.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="13-how-does-content-writing-differ-from-technical-writing">13. How does content writing differ from technical writing?<a href="https://techwriter.pl/kilka-pytan-do-czesc-30-marketing#13-how-does-content-writing-differ-from-technical-writing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do 13. How does content writing differ from technical writing?" title="Bezpośredni link do 13. How does content writing differ from technical writing?">​</a></h3>
<p>The first thing that immediately caught my attention was the distinction between
content writing, which emphasizes creativity and storytelling, and technical
writing, which prioritizes clarity and precision.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, technical writing adheres to strict style guides and
terminology, while content writing offers more flexibility in language and tone
to align with brand messaging.</p>
<p>Content writing often incorporates emotional appeal and customer-centric
language, whereas technical writing relies on facts, data, and an objective
tone.</p>
<p>The third aspect is that the primary goal of content writing is to drive sales
and conversions, while technical writing focuses on educating and informing
readers about complex topics or processes.</p>
<p>However, I believe that high-quality content writing should integrate effective
technical writing principles. This is because the primary objective should
always be to educate customers about how to use a product and address their
business needs. <strong>I refer to this as the convergence of the technical writing and

<p>Compared to the extensive toolkit of a technical writer, product marketers
typically use common tools like Microsoft Office Suite or Google Docs (depending
on the company).</p>
<p>They may also employ creative software like Adobe InDesign and Illustrator, when
needed. Some use mind mapping software for visual idea notes, while in some
cases, a simple pen and notepad would be enough, too.</p>
<p>The key is to capture ideas and maintain a continuous flow of content creation
and marketing strategy development.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="15-how-is-your-work-organized">15. How is your work organized?<a href="https://techwriter.pl/kilka-pytan-do-czesc-30-marketing#15-how-is-your-work-organized" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do 15.

<p>As we explore the intriguing parallels between the technical writing and content
writing domains, I was delighted to discover that the marketing department I had
previously collaborated with utilized a work management platform and held weekly
stand-up meetings. It felt like stumbling upon an agile treasure in the
marketing world!</p>
<p>These stand-up meetings not only facilitated discussions about our tasks and
challenges but also ignited a creative journey.</p>
<p>We delved deep into the content creation process by engaging in SME interviews,
conducting peer reviews, and participating in internal brainstorming sessions,
all while working as a team committed to delivering high-quality marketing
assets.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="16-do-you-work-alone-or-do-you-feel-a-part-of-the-team">16.

Do you work alone, or do you feel a part of the team?" title="Bezpośredni link do 16. Do you work alone, or do you feel a part of the team?">​</a></h3>
<p>Just as in technical writing, cross-collaboration is paramount. I have
experience collaborating with technical stakeholders, various marketing
departments, sales teams, and essentially every department within a company
whenever additional support and cooperation were needed for specific projects.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="17-personally-what-do-you-find-most-rewarding-about-this-domain">17.

<p>My most favorite aspect is the boundless room for creativity, where we can
breathe life into fresh ideas, experiment fearlessly, embrace mistakes as
lessons, make improvements, and begin anew.</p>
<p>Creative writing offers the perfect environment for continuous learning and
professional growth, enabling us to evolve into more experienced storytellers.</p>
<p>What makes it even more fascinating is the chance to inspire and captivate
audiences with the power of words, making a lasting impact through our
narratives and bringing value in understanding how a service or a product works.</p>

<p>When your creative ideas flow, your passion for writing becomes unmistakable.
It's a feeling you can't miss — the joy of turning thoughts into words on a
page. It's whenever you find yourself in a state of flow, and you might not
notice it at first.</p>
<p>There may be other hints - you may be creative in drawing, in knitting, in
capturing photos. There's this creative part of you that you definitely know
about. This is the magic of creativity, where your imagination comes to life.</p>
<p>I strongly believe that this might be a great hint for you to consider becoming
a content writer or a product marketer.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="19-hows-your-profession-affected-by-artificial-intelligence-based-tools">19. How's your profession affected by artificial intelligence based tools?<a href="https://techwriter.pl/kilka-pytan-do-czesc-30-marketing#19-hows-your-profession-affected-by-artificial-intelligence-based-tools" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do 19.

<p>It's unavoidable; AI is already here, and we might not fully comprehend its
reach. I strongly believe AI holds great potential, but we must exercise wisdom
in its application.</p>
<p>While it can be valuable for idea generation and perhaps editing, entrusting it
entirely, such as content creation, is a misstep. Relying solely on AI risks
diluting your brand, erasing your distinctiveness, and making you
indistinguishable from the rest.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="20-what-are-the-possible-further-career-options">20.

What are the possible further career options?" title="Bezpośredni link do 20. What are the possible further career options?">​</a></h3>
<p>I believe that if you have a true passion for something, you're likely to stay
in the same field. You might progress to higher positions, or you might find it
less important, and that's entirely your choice.</p>
<p>Currently, I don't see myself becoming a CMO or a higher-level manager, mainly
due to my current personality and values. However, that could change over time,
as we all naturally evolve. Change is a constant in life.</p>

<p>From my own work experience, I've encountered numerous stressful situations that
eventually took a toll on my health.</p>
<p>One instance, in particular, involved my inability to voice my concerns and my
constant fear of saying no. This led to throat constrictions and chronic sore
throats, resulting in frequent visits to a medical clinic. Only after addressing
this issue did my health improve.</p>
<p>I firmly believe in the profound connection between the mind and the body, and
that this connection is essential.</p>
<p>To effectively combat burnout, it's important to cleanse every aspect of your
energy. With that in mind, I highly recommend delving into the pages of this
book by Neha Sangwan:
<a href="https://intuitiveintelligenceinc.com/powered-by-me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Powered by Me: from Burned Out to Fully Charged at Word and in Life.</a>
Doctor Neha Sangwan explains how to rejuvenate the five levels of energy:
physical, mental, emotional, social, and spiritual. The toolkit provided is
truly remarkable, and I personally incorporate its principles into my daily
life.</p>

<p>I strongly believe that the convergence of these two worlds, technical writing
and marketing writing, represents the future of the industry, in my humble
opinion. They are interdependent, and incorporating the best practices from both
realms can set your business apart. You might wonder, what do I mean by that?</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, technical writers, acting as user advocates who provide
crucial information, add significant value when describing the product. They
focus on technical aspects and provide a comprehensive product explanation.</p>
<p>This can be further enhanced by product marketers who analyze customers'
business needs and transform product information into solutions and value
creators.</p>
<p>In my LinkedIn
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/rational-vs-emotional-product-marketing-oksana-pervenonok-aixke" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article</a>,
I explore various scenarios for promoting a product using technical information
about the products. This collaboration is a remarkable synergy, which is why I
refer to it as the convergence of worlds.</p>

<p>Certainly! A well-known prehistoric creature that could symbolize a creative and
storytelling professional that comes to my mind would be... the Tyrannosaurus!
It is an iconic and powerful dinosaur, much like how compelling storytelling and
creative content can have a strong impact.</p>

Andrzej Niewiarowski oraz członkini honorowa - Patrycja Pyrek -
przeprowadziliśmy wyjątkowy meetup, którego spoiwem była kultura Japonii.</p>

<p>12.09.2023 w siedzibie Hitachi Energy w Krakowie odbył się Fusion Meetup o
Technical Writingu i Karate dla pracowników firmy i gości spoza niej. Na
spotkaniu stawiło się 40 osób. Piotr wziął na siebie dużą część obowiązków
organizacyjnych, w czym ma już wprawę, bo ma na koncie przeprowadzenie
writerskiego meetupu w 2019.</p>
<p>Dla naszego zespołu ten fusion meetup to już drugie wspólne wydarzenie, bo w
2023 zorganizowaliśmy spotkanie z
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lance-cummings-phd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lance Cummings</a>, który w
krakowskiej siedzibie firmy opowiadał o tym, jak wykorzystywać <em>prompt
engineering</em> w arsenale pisarza technicznego.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pracując w japońskiej firmie, jaką jest Hitachi Energy, mamy okazję obcować z
kulturą japońską.</li>
<li>Wiele osób w zespole trenowało wschodnie sztuki walk i lubi oglądać filmy
prezentujące mistrzów sztuk walk.</li>
<li>Japońska filozofia kaizen stanowi filar dla praktyk takich jak Lean
Management, które stosujemy w Hitachi Energy.</li>
<li>W codziennej pracy technical writerów staramy się stale ulepszać metody pracy,
co jest zgodne z japońską zasadą dążenia do doskonałości.</li>
</ul>
<p>Niecodzienna fuzja tematów tego meetupu przypadła naszym gościom do gustu.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://techwriter.pl/assets/images/patrycja_jap-2c109497a0ccc4e28f2256218f739152.jpg" width="1070" height="802" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrycja-pyrek/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Patrycja Pyrek</a>, jako znawczyni
tematu, wprowadziła nas we frapujące meandry kultury japońskiej, którą poznała z
pierwszej ręki, kilkakrotnie odwiedzając Kraj Kwitnącej Wiśni i zgłębiając
miejscowe zwyczaje.</p>
<p>Słuchacze dowiedzieli się między innymi o tym, dlaczego nie należy wbijać
pałeczek w ryż podczas posiłku oraz jak rozumieć szyld z godzinami otwarcia
japońskiego sklepu od "23:00 - 25:00". Wyjaśnienie takiego zapisu jest
następujące: jeśli sklep jest czynny do 1:00 to do godziny 24:00 dodajemy jedną
i otrzymujemy 25:00 😊</p>

<p>W trakcie Meetupu
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/monika-klimek1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monika Dąbrowska</a> opowiedziała o
tym, co profesor Cialdini - specjalista na skalę światową w dziedzinie
wywierania wpływu - może doradzić pisarzom technicznym, którzy mają problem z
uzyskaniem uwag ekspertów domenowych co do opracowanego dokumentu.</p>
<p>W codziennych bojach, często zwracamy uwagę na narzędzia, problemy techniczne i
organizację pracy, a nie należy zapominać również o budowaniu zdrowych relacji
ze współpracownikami. Monika przedstawiła nam perspektywę na mechanizmy rządzące
budowaniem relacji między ludźmi. Otrzymaliśmy kilka praktycznych wskazówek,
które mogą pomóc podczas codziennej pracy dokumentalisty.</p>
<p>Warto tu zaznaczyć, że choć tematyka prac Cialdiniego niektórym może przywodzić
na myśl techniki makiawelicznej manipulacji, to znajomość uniwersalnych zasad,
którymi rządzi się ludzka natura, pomaga nam lepiej rozumieć samych siebie i tę
drugą osobę odgrywającą rolę Eksperta Domenowego.</p>
<p>Można spokojnie korzystać z tej wiedzy, mając krystalicznie czyste intencje i
bez robienia kogokolwiek w bambuko 😊</p>

<p>Mimo opornego projektora, który przestał działać jak tylko do niego podszedłem
(mam tę moc, mam tę moc!), udało mi się wyświetlić slajdy i opowiedzieć o
zarządzaniu priorytetami projektów dokumentacyjnych.</p>
<p>Podczas mojej blisko rocznej przygody w firmie Hitachi Energy miałem okazję
przećwiczyć dostosowywanie priorytetów w dynamicznym środowisku, w którym tech
writer ma więcej niż jeden projekt pod swoją pieczą.</p>
<p>Cieszę się, że mogłem podzielić się obserwacjami, które mogą być pomocne również
w kontekstach pozadokumentacyjnych, a także zaprezentowałem parę czerstwych
memów własnego autorstwa.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://techwriter.pl/assets/images/lee-b1de5a427ea20ee60c6474270cc52ca5.png" width="1214" height="538" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Uczestnicy i uczestniczki zdarzenia okazywali zainteresowanie, zadali nawet
pytania, a po zapaleniu świateł wszyscy byli obudzeni 😉 Dla mnie to definicja
sukcesu.</p>

<p>Wisienką na torcie była rozmowa z sensei Mają Wójcik i sensei Jakubem Piaseckim,
którzy opowiadali o dążeniu do mistrzostwa w dziedzinie karate Oyama oraz
pozytywnych wartościach sportowych jakie niesie ze sobą ten sport.</p>
<p>Dowiedzieliśmy się również o tym jak:</p>
<ul>
<li>Znajdować w sobie wewnętrzną siłę, by systematycznie rozwijać swoje
umiejętności</li>
<li>Przekonać siebie samego do pójścia na pierwszy trening</li>
</ul>
<p>Mieliśmy przyjemność posłuchać opowieści młodych, ambitnych trenerów, a ich
rozważania na temat samodoskonalenia i sposobów radzenia sobie z trudnościami
mają również zastosowanie w kontekście technical writingu.</p>
<p>Ważnym przesłaniem tamtego wieczoru było to, że uprawianie sportu jest dobrą
metodą na zagwarantowanie sobie właściwego stanu mentalnego.</p>
<p>Aktywność fizyczna jest świetnym remedium na pracę umysłową w świecie IT:
pozwala na zachowanie wewnętrznej równowagi i wydobycie pełni swojego
potencjału.</p>

<p>Jakub wspomniał również o swojej drugiej pasji życiowej, którą jest fotografia.
Karate było motywem przewodnim jego pracy dyplomowej, a przykłady jego prac
mogliśmy podziwiać w trakcie spotkania.</p>

mogli poczęstować się przekąskami, powymieniać się uwagami i poznać nowych

<p>Każdy mógł zabrać do domu wybrany gadżet z logo Hitachi Energy.</p>
<p>W tym miejscu podziękowania dla

która pomogły w zorganizowaniu kateringu i gadżetów.</p>
<p>Doszły mnie słuchy, że uczestnicy chwalili sobie to wydarzenie, na firmowym
intranecie padło o tym kilka komentarzy 😊</p>
<p>Jestem po dużym wrażeniem zespołu, który wybrał tak nieoczywisty pomysł i
kreatywnie rozwinął go, dzięki czemu mogliśmy podzielić się doświadczeniami i
poznać naprawdę zacną widownię.</p>
<p>Dziękujemy wszystkim serdecznie za przybycie i obiecujemy, że nie osiądziemy na
laurach.</p>]]></content>

<p>Grudniowy meetup upłynął nam w atmosferze przedświątecznej - i choć w ojczystym języku unboxing nie brzmi tak zgrabnie, gubimy również subtelną grę językową gdyż nasza prelegentka, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/barbara-szwarc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Basia Czyż</a>, pracuje w firmie Box, to jej prezentacja zatytułowana: UnBOXing API Documentation dała nam dużo radości 😉</p>
<p>5 grudnia w siedzibie firmy Infor, Basia Czyż, na co dzień <em>Senior Technical Writer</em> w firmie Box oraz jedna z krakowskich organizatorek MeetContentKRK przybliżyła nam temat dokumentacji API.</p>
<p>Basia zaczęła swoją prezentację od tego co to jest API i dlaczego potrzebuje dokumentacji? Pozostając w świątecznym klimacie, koncept został wytłumaczony na przykładzie zapytań (GET) o prezenty w świątecznym worku.</p>
<p>W kolejnym kroku mogliśmy dopytywać o szczegóły dotyczące konkretnych prezentów (atrybuty), dodawać lub usuwać prezenty z worka (zasobu). Używając zapytań z metodą , POST lub DELETE można było też odpowiednio: dodać nowy prezent albo całkowicie prezent z worka usunąć.</p>
<p>Na zapytania przychodzą odpowiedzi, które zwracają na przykład konkretny kolor, rodzaj lub rozmiar czyli wartości atrybutów, w zależności o co pytaliśmy.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="po-co-dokumentować-api">Po co dokumentować API?<a href="https://techwriter.pl/meetcontent-wroclaw-grudzien-2023-podsumowanie#po-co-dokumentowa%C4%87-api" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Po co dokumentować API?" title="Bezpośredni link do Po co dokumentować API?">​</a></h3>
<p>Cel dokumentacji API jest dość jasny: bez niej użytkownicy byliby skazani na metodę prób i błędów i szybkość współpracy i integracji z nowym API pozostawiałby wiele do życzenia.</p>
<p>API nie ma interfejsu, a dokumentacja jest jedyną widoczną wskazówką w zakresie:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jak to działa?</li>
<li>Jakie ścieżki prowadzą do jakich zasobów?</li>
<li>Jakie zasoby są w ogóle dostępne do odpytania?</li>
<li>Jakich parametrów użyć w zapytaniu oraz jak odczytać to co zostanie zwrócone?</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="api-w-boxie">API w BOXie<a href="https://techwriter.pl/meetcontent-wroclaw-grudzien-2023-podsumowanie#api-w-boxie" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do API w BOXie" title="Bezpośredni link do API w BOXie">​</a></h3>
<p>Basia opowiedziała nam nieco o procesie powstawania nowych API oraz o procesie dokumentacyjnym.
Dokumentacja API firmy Box dostępna jest publicznie pod <a href="https://developer.box.com/reference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TYM LINKIEM</a>. Dokumentacja jest podzielona na tematyczne grupy, pozwalając szybko odnaleźć zasoby które interesują użytkowników a także dostępne endpointy, których z kolei można użyć, żeby uzyskać konkretne informacje dotyczące danego zasobu.</p>
<p>Każdy z zasobów opisany jest w szczegółach i zawiera informacje o parametrach zapytania, opisy atrybutów, kody błedu, przykładowe zapytanie i odpowiedź.</p>
<p>Podlinkowane są też materiały pomocnicze, dodające kontekst i ułatwiające użytkownikom zintegrowanie się z API.</p>
<p>Często API jest skomplikowane i wymaga wykonania całej litanii zapytań w określonej kolejności. Materiały pomocnicze, tzw. <em>integration guides</em>, nie należą bezpośrednio do dokumentacji danego zasobu ale są niezbędne żeby poprawnie API używać i pozwalają na odtworzenie rekomendowanej ścieżki działań.</p>
<p>API, które dokumentuje Basia, obejmuje także dodatkowe, reużywalne atrybuty, których można użyć do skonstruowania zapytania i odpowiedzi. Jeżeli zaistnieje taka potrzeba, atrybuty mogą mieć kilka wersji.
Takie podejście pozwala na ponowne używanie istniejących parametrów (content reuse) i zachowanie spójności nazewnictwa i opisów.</p>
<p>Zasoby, endpointy i atrybuty dokumentowane są w osobnych plikach .yml, z których potem budowana jest specyfikacja - jeden duży plik JSON.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="wyzwania">Wyzwania<a href="https://techwriter.pl/meetcontent-wroclaw-grudzien-2023-podsumowanie#wyzwania" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Wyzwania" title="Bezpośredni link do Wyzwania">​</a></h3>
<p>Oczywiście dokumentacja API ma swoje wyzwania, które różne firmy starają się przezwyciężyć na różne sposoby. Wyzwania dla dokumentalisty biorą się również z samych założeń wyjściowych jakie firma przyjmie.</p>
<p>I tak w przypadku dokumentacji do Box API, dużym wyzwaniem są tak zwane breaking changes, czyli zmiany w API, które zmuszają klientów do ponownej integracji. Na przykład zmianą typu breaking change jest usunięcie atrybutu, który już jest wykorzystywany w integracjach.</p>
<p>Kolejnym wyzwaniem jest też wersjonowanie API i utrzymywanie (lub nie - w zależności od użytkowników i polityki firmy) starych wersji.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="dokumentacja-api---jak-to-ugryźć">Dokumentacja API - jak to ugryźć?<a href="https://techwriter.pl/meetcontent-wroclaw-grudzien-2023-podsumowanie#dokumentacja-api---jak-to-ugry%C5%BA%C4%87" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Dokumentacja API - jak to ugryźć?" title="Bezpośredni link do Dokumentacja API - jak to ugryźć?">​</a></h3>
<p>Basia miała kilka cennych wskazówek dla dokumentalistów chcących zająć się dokumentowaniem API:</p>
<ul>
<li>Po pierwsze, trzeba API poznać, a to najlepiej wychodzi poprzez rozmowę z programistami, którzy to je tworzą.</li>
<li>Kolejna sprawa to nie skakanie od razu na głęboką wodę i zaczęcie od wysokopoziomowych integration guides, żeby dać sobie szansę zapoznać się z dostępnymi zasobami, ich przeznaczeniem i tym jak wpasowują się w szerszy ekosystem produktu.</li>
<li>Jak już nabierzemy wprawy, to dobrze jest też być blisko zespołów kiedy nowe dopiero API powstaje, żeby widzieć jego przeznaczenie i funkcje od samego początku.</li>
</ul>

<p>Basia postanowiła podzielić się swoją prezentacją, którą znajdziecie <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Fnu2R4MOmnrevXZIL6IocnxRp5TMpjg4/edit#slide=id.p1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TUTAJ</a> 🤩
W prezentacji są również przetestowane i polecane kursy i źródła wiedzy do nauki o API.</p>
<p>Oceniając po dużej ilośc pytań do naszej prelegentki wnioskujemy, że temat cieszy się dużym zainteresowaniem.</p>
<p>Dziękujemy i do zobaczenia następnym razem!</p>

<p><em>Alt tekst: Cichy bohater w służbie dostępności</em></p>
<p>Podczas naszego listopadowego spotkania dowiecie się czym jest tekst
alternatywny, oraz jak i dlaczego go używać. Innymi słowy, dowiecie się jak
sprawić, żeby wszyscy zrozumieli żart nawet jeżeli nie mogą zobaczyć mema.</p>
<p>Naszą prelegentką jest <strong>Patrycja Guzik</strong>, technical writerka z prawie
dziewięcioletnim stażem. Z tworzeniem dokumentacji zetknęła się przypadkiem, ale
wraz z upływam lat odkryła w sobie pasję do pisania. Celem Patrycji jest
przedstawianie złożonych treści w sposób przystępny (i dostępny) dla
użytkownika, a pomagają jej w tym eksperymenty z materiałami wizualnymi i
architekturą informacji.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>18 listopada</strong> wystartowała czwarta edycja studiów podyplomowych na kierunku
Komunikacja Techniczna. Czego nauczą się tegoroczni studenci?
Szczegóły poniżej.</p>
<p>Kolejny rok z rzędu objęliśmy patronatem kierunek
<a href="https://www.vistula.edu.pl/kierunki-studiow/studia-podyplomowe/informatyka/komunikacja-techniczna" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Komunikacja Techniczna na Akademii Finansów i Biznesu Vistula</a>. Nieustannie nas cieszy spore zainteresowanie i nie mamy wątpliwości, że przyczynia się do tego pozytywny odbiór poprzednich edycji.</p>
<p>Zachęcamy Was do przeczytania artykułów naszej redakcyjnej
koleżanki Magdy, absolwentki tego kierunku, która dzieli się swoimi
wrażeniami:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://techwriter.pl/komunikacja-techniczna-jak-sie-studiuje/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">po pierwszym semestrze</a></li>
<li><a href="http://techwriter.pl/komunikacja-techniczna-drugi-semestr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">po drugim semestrze</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Wiemy również, że część studentów znalazła pracę w trakcie lub zaraz po obronach prac, jak choćby <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pawel-woznikowski_this-is-probably-my-most-personal-professional-activity-7114579776916353024-kC8e/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paweł</a>.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="co-się-zmienia-a-co-pozostaje">Co się zmienia a co pozostaje?<a href="https://techwriter.pl/wystartowa%C5%82a%20czwarta%20edycja%20studiow-podyplomowych-komunikacja-techniczna#co-si%C4%99-zmienia-a-co-pozostaje" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Co się zmienia a co pozostaje?" title="Bezpośredni link do Co się zmienia a co pozostaje?">​</a></h3>
<p>W odpowiedzi na opinie studentów, prowadzący nieustannie starają się modyfikować program studiów dopasowując go do aktualnych potrzeb. Przykładowo, zwiększono liczbę praktycznych zajęć w pierwszym semestrze oraz wprowadzono zajęcia z pisania przy użyciu AI. Studenci będą mogli dzięki temu więcej czasu w drugim semestrze poświęcić na projekt końcowy, który będzie ich wizytówką i głównym elementem ich profesjonalnego portfolio.
Warto podkreślić, że w programie znajduje się pełny kurs przygotowujący do certyfikacji ITCQF. Koszt takiego szkolenia na wolnym
rynku to praktycznie połowa kosztu całych studiów. Biorąc to pod uwagę, stosunek jakości
do ceny studiów przedstawia się bardzo korzystnie.</p>
<p>Również w czwartej edycji kierunek kontynuuje współpracę z University of North Carolina
Wilmington. Studenci wraz z kolegami i
koleżankami z USA mogą współpracować przy projektach prowadzonych w ramach
kierunku „Writing in Intercultural and Global Contexts”. To doskonała okazja, by
zdobyć nowe doświadczenie, szersze perspektywy, nowe znajomości i cenny wpis do
CV. Szczegóły <a href="https://www.craft.do/s/VOd7B47ytH4bhA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tutaj</a>.</p>
<p>Kadrę zasilił Lance Cummings, znany z corocznych wystąpień na <a href="https://soapconf.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">konferencji soap!</a>. Wykładowcy to tylko i wyłącznie praktycy, którzy
są rozpoznawalni na międzynarodowej scenie techcommu.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="partnerzy">Partnerzy<a href="https://techwriter.pl/wystartowa%C5%82a%20czwarta%20edycja%20studiow-podyplomowych-komunikacja-techniczna#partnerzy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Partnerzy" title="Bezpośredni link do Partnerzy">​</a></h3>
<p>Dzięki współpracy z partnerami (memoQ, MadCap oraz Atlassian) uczestnicy mają możliwość poznania najpopularniejszych i często bardzo drogich
narzędzi wykorzystywanych przez profesjonalnych technical writerów. Komunikacja na studiach odbywa się na Confluence, a wszystkie zadania śledzone są w Jira. Zajęcia prowadzone są na platformie Microsoft Teams. Projekty tworzone są przy użyciu MadCap Flare, Oxygena, czy narzędzi i technik wspierających DocAsCode.</p>
<h1>Najważniejsze informacje o studiach</h1>
<p>Studia są w 100% zdalne, mogą w nich brać udział osoby z dowolnego miejsca w
Polsce i na świecie. Nadal można dołączyć.</p>
<p>Zajęcia trwają dwa semestry i kosztują 6800 zł. Na oba semestry organizatorzy
przewidzieli 170 godzin wykładów i warsztatów. Każdy absolwent studiów będzie miał możliwość
(za dodatkową opłatą wynoszącą 800 zł brutto) uzyskania międzynarodowego
certyfikatu <a href="https://itcqf.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ITCQF</a> (Foundation Certificate in Technical
Communication).</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Jesteśmy <em>contentowcami</em>, czyli ludźmi, którzy zarabiają pisząc. Niestety jednak
w wielu przypadkach traktujemy nasze CV jak cała reszta poszukiwaczy ‘nowych
wyzwań’ - czyli jak worek do którego wrzucamy wszystko co robiliśmy i czego
kiedykolwiek się uczyliśmy.</p>
<p>Jako Hiring Manager, jestem odpowiedzialna za rekrutację do swojego zespołu w
Ocado. Wspieram również rekrutacje innych hiring managerów, pomagająca ocenić
kandydatów do innych zespołów.</p>
<p>Do tej pory miałam okazję obejrzeć dosłownie setki CV kandydatów z całego
świata. Ten artykuł powstał na podstawie moich doświadczeń:</p>
<ul>
<li>kiedy CV mówiło mi więcej o kandydacie niż kandydat chciał powiedzieć</li>
<li>czego wolałabym nie widzieć w CV a co wręcz przeciwnie byłoby bardzo przydatne</li>
<li>co sprawiało, że konkretne CV wyróżniało się spośród innych</li>
</ul>

<p>Mówi się, że pierwsze wrażenie można zrobić tylko raz. Dlaczego więc nie
przykładamy odpowiedniej wagi do naszego intro albo całkowicie je pomijamy i
wrzucamy odbiorcę wprost w meandry naszego doświadczenia zawodowego?</p>
<p>Często ciężko jest nam streścić swoje doświadczenie, umiejętności i cenne cechy
charakteru w jednym, góra dwóch paragrafach. I to jest zrozumiałe. Ale kim my
jesteśmy? Tech Writerami, ludźmi którzy zarabiają na życie tym, że są w stanie
przekazać sens w krótkiej i ograniczonej formie pisarskiej jaką jest error
message lub wymyślić nazwę dla przycisku, który zbiera i przetwarza dane z wielu
mikroserwisów i reprezentuje skomplikowane zależności.</p>
<p>W świecie szeroko rozumianego Product Managementu popularne jest stwierdzenie
‘everything as a product’. Host mojego ulubionego podcastu produktowego, The
skip, Nikhyl Singhal, mówi wprost: jeśli jesteś Product Managerem, potraktuj
swoją karierę jak produkt.</p>
<p>A może by tak potraktować nasze CV jako produkt? Jeśli pracujemy w branży
dokumentacyjnej, a CV to produkt, co by było gdybyśmy potraktowali nasze CV jak
dokumentację?</p>
<p>A więc podejdźmy do tematu intro jeszcze raz:</p>
<p>Intro to wysokopoziomowe streszczenie tego o czym będzie artykuł czy topik. To
tak zwana wersja dla zabieganych - jeśli użytkownik (tu: Rekruter lub Hiring
Manager) chce rozeznać się czy jesteś odpowiednim kandydatem, chce dostać
streszczenie, pill-size, chce się upewnić, że warto czytać dalej.</p>
<p>Rzadko kiedy Hiring Manager ma dużo czasu, żeby przyjrzeć się naszemu CV.
Prawdopodobnie dostaje ich kilkanaście na tydzień a zapewniam Was, że tytuł
Hiring Manager dostaje się tylko na czas otwartej rekrutacji i nie zawiesza on
wszystkich innych innych obowiązków, które ta osoba pełni w firmie… 😉</p>
<p>Co w takim razie wpisać w intro, żeby przykuło wzrok i sprawiło, że będą czytać
dalej? Odpowiedź jest klasyczna: to zależy 😉</p>
<p>Ale jest na to kilka sposobów:</p>
<ol>
<li>Przeczytaj dokładnie ofertę na którą aplikujesz.</li>
<li>Zwróć uwagę na słowa kluczowe, które zawiera oferta. Niekoniecznie będą one w
wymaganiach, mogą pojawić się w opisie stanowiska. Na przykład: agile
environment, continuous delivery, dita, docs-as-code, etc…</li>
<li>Wynotuj słowa kluczowe, które są zbieżne z tym w czym masz doświadczenie.
Zwróć uwagę czy używałeś narzędzi, które wymienia oferta pracy?</li>
<li>Feed back - dosłownie. Postaraj się stworzyć paragraf, który opowie skrótowo
historię o Tobie, ale owiń wątek dookoła słów kluczowych, które
zidentyfikowałeś. Przedstaw się, opowiedz kim jesteś, podkreśl przy tym swoje
mocne strony.</li>
<li>Używaj przymiotników z umiarem. Słowa takie jak ‘passionate’, ‘excellent’,
‘exceptional’, są ok ale zostały już tak nadużyte, że obecnie brzmią już
sztucznie i pusto. Trzymaj się realnych umiejętności, opisując swoje zalety.</li>
<li>Zastosuj zasady, które stosujesz przy pisaniu dokumentacji technicznej,
trzymaj się faktów: Ludzie lubią z Tobą współpracować? Wybierz proste: <em>I am
easy to work with</em> zamiast wyświechtanego: <em>I am an excellent team player</em>.
Zamiast pisać: <em>I am passionate about technical communication</em>, użyj: <em>I make
sure that the documentation I write adds value to the product</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>W skrócie: Keep it simple.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="doświadczenie">Doświadczenie<a href="https://techwriter.pl/skuteczne-cv-czyli-jakie#do%C5%9Bwiadczenie" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Doświadczenie" title="Bezpośredni link do Doświadczenie">​</a></h2>
<p>Zabierając się za opis doświadczenia, zrób przysługę Rekruterom i Hiring
Managerom i pod nazwą firmy, krótko streść z jakiej branży jest to firma i w
jakim projekcie pracowałeś.</p>
<p>Działka UX już dawno ustaliła, że lepiej nie prowokować użytkownika do
opuszczania Twojego produktu czy aplikacji, lepiej nie wyprowadzać go z
kontekstu. Dlatego zwiększ usability swojego ‘produktu’, nie każ im
niepotrzebnie opuszczać twojego CV i szukać w internecie z jakiej branży jest
lub była Twoja firma.</p>
<p>Dodaj informację, czy pisałeś w tej firmie dokumentację do software’u czy
hardware’u. To są istotne informacje, które według zasady front-loading’u
powinny znaleźć się na początku Twojego podsumowania.</p>
<p>Zwróć uwagę na to jak zapisujesz daty okresu, w którym pracowałeś w różnych
firmach. I tu znowu przyda się odniesienie do dokumentacji technicznej, sprawdź
co mówi Twój ulubiony style guide o zapisie dat i tego się trzymaj w całym CV.</p>
<p>Przykładowo, jeśli wybierzesz zapis: 01.10.2018 - 31.12.2020, to się go trzymaj.
Nie zapisuj kolejnego okresu zatrudnienia: 1 January 2021 - 01.12.2021.</p>
<p>Sprawdź jeszcze raz czy nie wkradły się różnego rodzaju myślniki pomiędzy
datami, np. em dash czy zwykły minus. Niby mała rzecz, ale jeśli w opisie
stwierdzasz, że masz słynne ‘attention to detail’, to bądź w stanie to udowodnić
😉</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="kategoryzuj-i-grupuj">Kategoryzuj i grupuj<a href="https://techwriter.pl/skuteczne-cv-czyli-jakie#kategoryzuj-i-grupuj" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Kategoryzuj i grupuj" title="Bezpośredni link do Kategoryzuj i grupuj">​</a></h3>
<p>Kolejnym sposobem na zwiększenie usability swojego CV to umiejętność
pogrupowania swoich obowiązków i przypisania ich do konkretnych kategorii.
Chodzi o to, żeby nie wyliczać listy obowiązków które wykonywaliśmy bez ładu i
składu, zaczynają od współpracy z różnymi SME (kategoria: współpraca), przez UX
writing, do tworzenia diagramów (kategoria: visuals), pisania error messages
(kategoria: microcopy), etc.</p>
<p>W branży tech writerskiej możemy użyć przykładowo takich kategorii:</p>
<ul>
<li>Release related</li>
<li>Visuals</li>
<li>UX writing</li>
</ul>
<p>Pod każdą z nich wyszczególnimy swoje obowiązki i / lub narzędzia, których
używaliśmy w tym kontekście.</p>
<ul>
<li>Release related<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Coordinating documentation publishing</li>
<li>Drafting release notes</li>
<li>Announcing releases internally, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Zacznij od pracodawcy u którego pracujesz aktualnie, jeśli nadal tam pracujesz,
listę swoich obowiązków możesz zacząć od czasownika w formie continuous, czyli
np:</p>
<ul>
<li>Working on…</li>
<li>Coordinating…</li>
<li>Cooperating…</li>
</ul>
<p>Jeśli przejdziesz już do poprzedniego pracodawcy, możesz dla podkreślenia używać

kropka, przecinek czy nic? Na cokolwiek się zdecydujesz, używaj tej formy
spójnie w całym dokumencie. Bądź też przygotowany na to, że na rozmowie o pracę
padnie pytanie: <em>Według jakiego style guide zostało napisane Twoje CV? Czy
możesz wskazać elementy, które tego dowodzą?</em></p>

<p>Coś o czym chyba za rzadko wspominamy, czyli podkreślanie różnorodności funkcji
z jakimi nam jako Tech Writerom przychodzi współpracować, układać stosunki i
negocjować swoje obowiązki.</p>
<p>Dodaj do CV kategorię Cooperation i wypisz wszystkie funkcje z którymi przyszło
ci pracować w danej firmie, np: UX Designers, UX Researchers, Data Analysts,
Solutions Architects… Zwróć uwagę jak zapisujesz nazwy stanowisk? Z dużej
litery? Z małej? W sumie nie ma to wielkiego znaczenia dopóki zapisujesz tak
samo w całym CV! 😉</p>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="czego-się-nauczyłeś">Czego się nauczyłeś?<a href="https://techwriter.pl/skuteczne-cv-czyli-jakie#czego-si%C4%99-nauczy%C5%82e%C5%9B" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Czego się nauczyłeś?" title="Bezpośredni link do Czego się nauczyłeś?">​</a></h3>
<p>Jeśli masz miejsce i trochę fantazji, możesz po wyliczeniu listy swoich
obowiązków u danego pracodawcy napisać jedną lub dwie rzeczy, których się tam
nauczyłeś lub poznałeś.</p>
<p>W ten sposób opowiadasz historię o swojej podróży zawodowej (storytelling).
Budujesz wizję rozwoju i tego, że ciągle idziesz do przodu, mimo że twoje
obowiązki mogą się niewiele różnić między pracodawcami, możesz za pomocą
krótkiego zdania What I’ve learned dodać wartość do swojego CV.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="wykształcenie-i-kursy">Wykształcenie i kursy<a href="https://techwriter.pl/skuteczne-cv-czyli-jakie#wykszta%C5%82cenie-i-kursy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Wykształcenie i kursy" title="Bezpośredni link do Wykształcenie i kursy">​</a></h2>
<p>Tu podobnie jak w doświadczeniu, nie pisz serii akronimów. Hiring Manager, który
będzie to czytał niekoniecznie posiada wiedzę o każdym rodzaju certyfikatu i
kursu, który można zdobyć. Czasem robimy też kursy spoza nasze branży. Miej
litość i dodaj krótkie wyjaśnienie co to za kurs, np: <em>ITCQF Foundation Level –
Certified Technical Communication Professional</em>.</p>
<p>Chodzi o to, żeby sekcja <em>Kursy</em> nie przywitała odbiorcy czymś takim:</p>
<ul>
<li>ITCQF</li>
<li>ISTQB</li>
<li>PMI-ACP</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="linki">Linki<a href="https://techwriter.pl/skuteczne-cv-czyli-jakie#linki" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Linki" title="Bezpośredni link do Linki">​</a></h2>
<p>Masz profil na GitHubie lub dokumentacja, którą pisałeś jest dostępna online?
Dodaj link w swoim CV - szczególnie jeśli publiczna dokumentacja podpisana jest
twoim nazwiskiem.</p>
<p>Niekoniecznie dobrym rozwiązaniem jest wklejanie linków do swojego prywatnego
bloga, gdzie piszesz content nietechniczny, ale to też może zależeć.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="jedno-cv---jedno-stanowisko">Jedno CV - jedno stanowisko?<a href="https://techwriter.pl/skuteczne-cv-czyli-jakie#jedno-cv---jedno-stanowisko" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Jedno CV - jedno stanowisko?" title="Bezpośredni link do Jedno CV - jedno stanowisko?">​</a></h2>
<p>Jest takie podejście że trzeba pisać CV pod konkretne stanowisko o które chcemy
się ubiegać. Oczywiście można, ale ja uważam, że lepszym wyjściem jest
stworzenie kilku CV pod konkretne rodzaje stanowisk i używanie ich w zależności
od tego co się pojawi. Oczywiście jeśli chcemy ubiegać się o różne role.</p>
<p>Na przykład, oddzielne CV na stanowiska:</p>
<ul>
<li>UX Writera</li>
<li>Senior Edytora</li>
<li>API Writer</li>
</ul>
<p>Jedno jest pewne, trzeba przyłożyć się do napisania kilku wersji Intro tak, żeby
precyzyjnie trafiało w powtarzające się wymagania w danym typie oferty pracy
(np. UX Writera).</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="jak-długie">Jak długie?<a href="https://techwriter.pl/skuteczne-cv-czyli-jakie#jak-d%C5%82ugie" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Jak długie?" title="Bezpośredni link do Jak długie?">​</a></h2>
<p>Jeśli masz CV dłuższe niż dwie strony, zastanów się czy nie warto pokombinować z
formatem, np. kolumny czy orientacja tekstu. Dłuższe CV też wysyłają jakąś
wiadomośc do Hiring Managera. Niekoniecznie jest to wiadomość, którą chcesz
wysłać, czyli np. że nie panujesz nad przekazem, nie potrafisz syntezować. A to
są umiejętności dla Technical Writera kluczowe.</p>
<p>Tu polecam słynną już książkę
<a href="https://www.amazon.pl/Content-Design-Sarah-Winters/dp/1916323316" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Content Design</a>.
Zaskakująca pozycja w której autorka, Sarah Winters, burzy koncepcje o tym jak
ma wyglądać książka a jednocześnie ten dość niestandardowy sposób przekazu ‘robi
robotę’ i treść dociera do czytelnika efektywniej niż gdyby miała być
przedstawiona w sposób konwencjonalny.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="narzędzia">Narzędzia<a href="https://techwriter.pl/skuteczne-cv-czyli-jakie#narz%C4%99dzia" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Narzędzia" title="Bezpośredni link do Narzędzia">​</a></h2>
<p>Można w klasycznym edytorze tekstu, można użyć automatycznych szablonów proponowanych przez LinkedIn - tu jednak warto zwrócić uwagę na formaty, które mogę zwyczajnie się 'rozjechać'. Dostępnych jest też sporo różnych kreatorów CV, które pomogą nadać naszemu dokumentowi nieco bardziej współczesny wygląd i odzwierciedlić nasz indywidualny styl.</p>
<p>Jednym z nich jest darmowy program graficzny Canva. Ten funkcjonalny kreator CV jest prosty w obsłudze, a jednocześnie oferuje ogromne możliwości. Użytkownik może utworzyć CV "od zera" lub wybierać z bogatego katalogu szablonów i w prosty sposób dostosowywać je do swoich oczekiwań.</p>
<p>Dokładną instrukcję tworzenia CV w programie Canva oraz szereg porad ułatwiających szybką edycję takich dokumentów znajdziecie na stronie <a href="https://www.canva.com/pl_pl/tworzyc/cv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Canva</a>.</p>

<p>Podchodząc do swojego CV jak do dokumentacji (produktu) można by jeszcze pewnie
pisać długo. Dlatego powyższa lista nie jest wyczerpująca.</p>
<p>Mam jednak nadzieję, że jeśli zainspirujecie się tym podejściem, to wasze CV
pomoże wam wyróżnić się na tle innych kandydatów. Zmiana perspektywy i
zastosowanie produktowego podejścia, może nam dać świeże spojrzenie na narzędzia
które znamy i których używamy na co dzień.</p>
<p>Jestem bardzo ciekawa jakie są Wasze obserwacje i doświadczenia jeśli chodzi o
pisanie CV.</p>]]></content>

<p>Co roku, 30 września, w dniu św. Hieronima, tłumacza Biblii, uznawanego za
patrona tłumaczy, obchodzony jest Międzynarodowy Dzień Tłumacza. I w tym samym
terminie, już od kilku lat, organizowana jest Konferencja Tłumaczy. Nie inaczej
było i w tym roku.</p>

<p>Motywem przewodnim tegorocznej Konferencji Tłumaczy była INTELIGENCJA. Dyskusje
toczyły się wokół inteligencji językowej (czyli czegoś, co każdy lingwista
posiada, ale musi też o to dbać), społecznej (czyli umiejętności współpracy z
innymi osobami), emocjonalnej (czyli umiejętności zarządzania sobą z perspektywy
własnej osobowości i emocji odczuwanych w trakcie tłumaczenia) oraz sztucznej
(czyli wokół narzędzi takich jak ChatGPT, ChatSonic, Chinchilla, DeepL).</p>

<p>Jako przedsmak samej konferencji w piątek, 29 września, odbyły się warsztaty z
ekspertami, poruszającymi zarówno odwieczne, jak i aktualne kwestie nurtujące
branżę tłumaczeniową.</p>
<p>Dyskutowano więc o kwestiach takich jak stawki za tłumaczenia, reklamowanie
swoich usług tłumaczeniowych w sieci czy emisja głosu. Gratką dla uczestników
były warsztaty dotyczące zastosowania ChatGPT i AI w tłumaczeniach. Było o
wielkich modelach językowych (tzw. LLM-ach), prompt engineeringu, łączeniu
CAT-ów (czyli narzędzi wspomagających tłumaczenie), NMT (neuronowego tłumaczenia
maszynowego) i LLM (wielkich modeli językowych). Dyskutowano o anonimizacji,
poufności i ochronie danych wrażliwych w ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Na koniec chętni uczestnicy mogli zobaczyć, jak działa narzędzie Juremy
ułatwiające wyszukiwanie różnorakich terminów w 24 językach unijnych. Szkolenie
to było skierowanie przede wszystkim do tłumaczy zajmujących się tłumaczeniem
tekstów unijnych i prawniczych.</p>

<p>Właściwa konferencja odbyła się w sobotę, 30 września. Na wykładach i
prelekcjach pojawiło się mnóstwo tłumaczy i osób związanych z branżą
tłumaczeniową. Kto nie mógł pojawić się osobiście, miał szansę uczestniczyć w
konferencji online. Podobnie zresztą jak i niektórzy prelegenci, którym
zobowiązania zawodowe czy rodzinne nie pozwoliły wziąć udziału w wydarzeniu
osobiście.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="inteligencja-i-inne-tematy-okołotłumaczeniowe">Inteligencja i inne tematy okołotłumaczeniowe<a href="https://techwriter.pl/Konferencja%20T%C5%82umaczy%202023%20-%20relacja#inteligencja-i-inne-tematy-oko%C5%82ot%C5%82umaczeniowe" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Inteligencja i inne tematy okołotłumaczeniowe" title="Bezpośredni link do Inteligencja i inne tematy okołotłumaczeniowe">​</a></h2>
<p>Jak przystało na temat przewodni dyskutowano o szeroko pojętej inteligencji.
Było więc i o neurobiologii inteligencji, i o inteligencji emocjonalnej – czyli
o tym jak tłumacze ustni radzą sobie w trakcie tłumaczeń konferencyjnych i
środowiskowych wywołujących duże i skrajne emocje. Znalazło się też miejsce na
rozmowy o tym, jak rozpoznać u siebie mocne i słabe strony, jak osiągnąć
satysfakcję z pracy, jak nauczyć się kontrolować stres, a także jak unikać
rozczarowań i skutecznie się relaksować.</p>
<p>Dyskutowano również o praktycznych kwestiach z życia tłumaczy. Było o różnych
formach pracy z innymi, czyli o tzw. co-workingu, fizjologicznej emisji głosu na
co dzień oraz zarządzaniu procesami i projektami. Prelegenci dzielili się
również swoją wiedzą i doświadczeniem w kwestii tego, jak się przebranżowić oraz
jak wcześniej podnieść swoje kompetencje, żeby zmiana branży i zawodu poszła
gładko i bezproblemowo.</p>
<p>Nie zabrakło też zabawnych historii wpadek językowych z życia tłumacza
konferencyjnego, który często natrafia na rafy kulturowe czy językowe podczas
tłumaczenia. Było też i o języku inkluzywnym, który coraz częściej pojawia się w
dyskusjach w przestrzeni publicznej.</p>
<p>Gościem tegorocznej konferencji było również ukraińskie biuro tłumaczeń Task
Force, którego przedstawiciele opowiadali o zmieniającej się branży
tłumaczeniowej w Ukrainie, tendencjach i wyzwaniach stojących przed nimi.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ai-i-mt-na-tapecie">AI i MT na tapecie<a href="https://techwriter.pl/Konferencja%20T%C5%82umaczy%202023%20-%20relacja#ai-i-mt-na-tapecie" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do AI i MT na tapecie" title="Bezpośredni link do AI i MT na tapecie">​</a></h2>
<p>Jednak tegoroczna Konferencja Tłumaczy 2023 została zdominowana przez kwestie,
które wywołują od jakiegoś czasu spore emocje, rodzą nadzieje i obawy nie tylko
w przestrzeni publicznej, ale też w branży tłumaczeniowej. Chodzi mianowicie o
tłumaczenie maszynowe i sztuczną inteligencję.</p>
<p>Temat AI widziany oczami biura tłumaczeń rozpoczęła Magdalena Pluta z biura
tłumaczeń Skrivanek. Opowiedziała o tym, jak biuro wykorzystuje
narzędzia AI, jak zmieniają się potrzeby klientów i jak w związku z tym zmienia się zakres procesów, używanego oprogramowania i innych rozwiązań
oraz jak dostawcy radzą sobie z technologiami AI. Pałeczkę przejął
następnie Agenor Hoffmann-Delbor, który jest znaną postacią nie tylko w branży
tłumaczeniowej, ale również, a może przede wszystkim, lokalizacyjnej. Dzień
wcześniej poprowadził warsztaty tematycznie powiązane z sobotnią prelekcją.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://techwriter.pl/assets/images/thisisengineering-ada8b66550a5668d0f4e3890781510a2.PNG" width="7330" height="4889" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="zastosowanie-ai-w-tłumaczeniach">Zastosowanie AI w tłumaczeniach<a href="https://techwriter.pl/Konferencja%20T%C5%82umaczy%202023%20-%20relacja#zastosowanie-ai-w-t%C5%82umaczeniach" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Zastosowanie AI w tłumaczeniach" title="Bezpośredni link do Zastosowanie AI w tłumaczeniach">​</a></h2>
<p>Agenor Hoffmann-Delbor podszedł do tematu bardzo technicznie i rzeczowo. Było
nie tylko o AI w tłumaczeniach, ale przede wszystkim ogólnie o sztucznej
inteligencji, silnikach korzystających z niej, jej zastosowaniach, mocnych i
słabych stronach.</p>
<p>Samo określenie „sztuczna inteligencja” pojawiło się już w latach 50. XX wieku i
zostało spopularyzowane przez literaturę science-fiction wraz ze wzrostem jej
popularności. Dlatego można powiedzieć, że nie jest to nowy twór, ale twór w
nowej odsłonie, dający możliwości, których wcześniej nie było. A same prace nad
AI, czyli zdolnością rozpoznawania pewnych wzorców, wyciągania z tych wzorców
wniosków i stosowania ich w praktyce, trwają od dawna. Podobnie jest z
obecnością AI w branży tłumaczeniowej.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ai-w-tłumaczeniach-to-nic-nowego">AI w tłumaczeniach to nic nowego<a href="https://techwriter.pl/Konferencja%20T%C5%82umaczy%202023%20-%20relacja#ai-w-t%C5%82umaczeniach-to-nic-nowego" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do AI w tłumaczeniach to nic nowego" title="Bezpośredni link do AI w tłumaczeniach to nic nowego">​</a></h3>
<p>Nie jest prawdą, że w branży tłumaczeniowej przez dziesięciolecia sztucznej
inteligencji nie było, a pojawiła się nagle dopiero w ostatnim roku. Bo od dawna
istnieją rozwiązania, które były wykorzystywane w branży tłumaczeniowej już
wcześniej, np. rozpoznawanie tagów w CAT-ach, wybór tłumaczy przez AI zaszyte w
TMS, wyodrębnianie terminologii, wspomaganie weryfikacji i redakcji, testy
językowe w kontekście treści wrażliwych, alignment, rozpoznawanie
nietłumaczalnych elementów, MT/SMT/NMT, czy ocena jakości MT (MTQE).</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="llm-y-w-tłumaczeniach">LLM-y w tłumaczeniach<a href="https://techwriter.pl/Konferencja%20T%C5%82umaczy%202023%20-%20relacja#llm-y-w-t%C5%82umaczeniach" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do LLM-y w tłumaczeniach" title="Bezpośredni link do LLM-y w tłumaczeniach">​</a></h3>
<p>Agenor opowiadał o zastosowaniach LLM-ów (czyli wielkich modeli językowych) w
tłumaczeniach wg Custom.mt, których jest ponad 39. Wyróżniamy tu
przygotowanie danych do tłumaczenia, ocenę jakości tekstu źródłowego,
tłumaczenia, dalszą obróbkę, sprawdzenie jakości i wiele innych.</p>
<p>Prelegent mówił o tym, że w ciągu ostatniego roku zaobserwowano skok jakości
tłumaczeń przy użyciu LLM-ów. Rozpoznawały one poprawnie 5 na 6 słów w
tłumaczonym zdaniu, a co najważniejsze nie wymagało to poprawek przez
postedytora. W październiku 2022 były to 2 na 3 słowa. Jest to skok jakości z
66% do 83%. – Tak więc tempo, w którym wielkie modele językowe zyskują na
jakości tłumaczeniowej jest spore, ale to było do przewidzenia – stwierdził
Agenor.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="openai-translator">OpenAI Translator<a href="https://techwriter.pl/Konferencja%20T%C5%82umaczy%202023%20-%20relacja#openai-translator" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do OpenAI Translator" title="Bezpośredni link do OpenAI Translator">​</a></h3>
<p>Wskazując na obecność sztucznej inteligencji w tłumaczeniach Agenor opowiadał o
dodatku do Tradosa, czyli jednego z narzędzi wspomagających tłumaczenie, tzw.
CAT-ów. Dodatek ten ma zaszytą w sobie pewną liczbę promptów, czyli zapytań. Co
to oznacza? Ni mniej, ni więcej to, że za jego pomocą można zrobić różne
przeróbki techniczne tekstu. Zalicza się do tego: anonimizację, zmianę płci w tłumaczeniu,
podsumowanie, skrócanie tekstu, zmianę terminologii, wiele wersji tłumaczenia,
sprawdzenie gramatyki, sprawdzenie jakości podpowiedzi z różnych silników,
sprawdzenie „stosowności” tłumaczenia, dokańczanie podpowiedzi z pamięci
tłumaczeń i poprawianie ich.</p>
<p>Jak twierdzi prelegent, nie jest to najlepsze rozwiązanie. Po pierwsze dlatego,
że bazuje na pracy z fragmentami tekstu, oderwanymi od całego dokumentu, od
czego się dzisiaj odchodzi. Zwłaszcza, że modele językowe są w stanie pracować z
całym dokumentem i w nim odnaleźć kontekst. Po drugie dlatego, że dodatek ten
pozwala zaznaczyć i przeanalizować tylko jeden tekst – albo źródło, albo
tłumaczenie. Nie możemy wybrać jednocześnie i źródła, i tłumaczenia i zbadać,
czy źródło zostało dobrze przetłumaczone.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="trados-i-wtyczka-custommt">Trados i wtyczka Custom.MT<a href="https://techwriter.pl/Konferencja%20T%C5%82umaczy%202023%20-%20relacja#trados-i-wtyczka-custommt" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Trados i wtyczka Custom.MT" title="Bezpośredni link do Trados i wtyczka Custom.MT">​</a></h3>
<p>Ciekawostką jest wtyczka Custom.MT do Tradosa, która jest podłączona do wielu
różnych silników. I jeśli jest to ChatGPT, który korzysta z translatora DeepL,
to, jak twierdzi Agenor, możemy wrzucić do DeepL’a swój słownik ze swoją
terminologią, a potem możemy jeszcze to, co wygeneruje DeepL za pomocą prompta
dodatkowo udoskonalić.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="chatgpt">ChatGPT<a href="https://techwriter.pl/Konferencja%20T%C5%82umaczy%202023%20-%20relacja#chatgpt" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do ChatGPT" title="Bezpośredni link do ChatGPT">​</a></h3>
<p>Tematem, który przewijał się przez całą prezentację był ChatGPT – jak działa,
jak nim sterować, jak go uczyć, jakie ma źródła informacji (nie tylko
Wikipedia), jak znaleźć idealne zapytanie dla czata, jak zwiększyć skuteczność
zapytań, czy warto uczyć się „prompt engineering”.</p>
<p>Było o łamaniu modelu (poprzez zapytania typu jak zbudować bombę, czy jak porwać
kogoś dla okupu czy polecenia mu napisania wirusa). Jest to coraz trudniejsze,
bo wprowadza się coraz więcej zabezpieczeń przed tego typu zapytaniami.
Prelegent wspominał o ChatGPT na komórkę (można się z nim porozumiewać głosowo,
nie trzeba pisać promptów), poruszył temat poufności ChatGPT (przechowywanie
danych z promptów do celów nauki czata jest domyślnie wyłączone), przeglądania
Internetu w ChatGPT. Mówił, że istnieje ponad 1000 pluginów do ChatGPT.
Wspominał też o tym, że OpenAI udostępnia detektor tekstu pisanego – można
sprawdzić czy tekst (np. oddawany przez kogoś jako oryginalna praca autorska)
został napisany przez model.</p>

<p>„AI będzie potrzebować 10-15 lat, aby zastąpić dzisiejsze zawody. W tym czasie
powstanie podobna liczba nowych.” (Yann LeCun, Chief AI Scientist, Meta)</p>
<p>Prelegent mówił o tym, że wpływ AI na rynek pracy jest widoczny już dziś.
Istnieje wiele raportów, które podają, jaki wpływ na rynek pracy ma lub będzie
mieć sztuczna inteligencja.</p>
<p>I tak, Goldman Sachs przewiduje, że na skutek popularyzacji AI pracę straci 300
milionów osób. Ale też jest gros osób, które pracy nie stracą, a będą korzystać
z AI, żeby ją usprawnić. Prelegent podkreślał, że na rynku widoczny jest trend,
że firmy wstrzymują duże rekrutacje, redukują zespoły, szczególnie w świecie IT.
Trudno jest w tej chwili powiedzieć, na kogo firmy postawią, kto będzie
korzystać z copilotów, wspomagaczy. Ale firmy będą stawiać raczej na
doświadczone osoby, które będą w stanie ocenić rzetelność informacji, które
modele wytwarzają.</p>
<p>Ponadto według przeanalizowanych raportów około 18% pracy na świecie da się
skomputeryzować. A efekty są już widoczne na rynkach rozwiniętych. A ponad 66%
zawodów w USA jest podatne na wprowadzenie AI: 7% zostanie całkiem zastąpionych,
63% będzie pracować wspólnie z AI, 30% pozostanie bez zmian.</p>

<p>Na zakończenie prelekcji Agenor przedstawił kilka wypowiedzi, które świetnie
podsumowują stan AI na koniec września 2023.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://techwriter.pl/assets/images/stan_AI_na_koniec_wrzesnia-ab5ff96f6028cdb8db39d94d40db45a3.PNG" width="1288" height="772" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Dodał, że firmy mają swoją motywację, żeby wprowadzać zastosowanie AI. W branży
tłumaczeniowej trendy te też są już odczuwalne albo widoczne. Na pewnym etapie
poprawianie po maszynie nie będzie miało sensu. Postedycja, weryfikacja
tłumaczeń wykonanych przez maszynę jest ślepą uliczką, a funkcjonuje tylko
dlatego, że tłumaczenia nie są jeszcze wystarczająco dobrej jakości, bo to co
robią silniki nie jest wystarczająco dobre.</p>
<p>– Być może trzeba będzie pójść w tym kierunku. Trzeba być najlepszym w obszarze
kreatywności. Albo zawęzić swoją specjalizację do czegoś, co wymaga dużo więcej
niż tylko zerknięcia na ogromną porcję danych i wyciągnięcia z tego jakichś
wzorców – stwierdził na koniec Agenor.</p>

<p>Równie ciekawą prelekcją była prezentacja Janusza Mrzigoda o tajemniczym tytule
„MT a Jack Sparrow”. Prelegent próbował odpowiedzieć na pytanie, do czego nadaje
się obecnie tłumaczenie mechaniczne, a do czego nie. Zastanawiał się, czego
brakuje sztucznej inteligencji w tej kwestii. Inspiracją do rozważań były
zmagania z tłumaczeniem mechanicznym skryptów gier, które – może wbrew pozorom –
zaliczają się do tekstów specjalistycznych. Prezentacja była okraszona licznymi
przykładami tłumaczeń MT, często zabawnymi, pochodzącymi z tekstów gier.
Pojawiły się też nawiązania do innych tekstów, do których zrozumienia potrzeba
wiedzy ogólnej i specjalistycznej.</p>
<p>Na początek prelegent zaserwował uczestnikom garść przykładów tłumaczenia, jak
mogłoby się wydawać, prostych wyrażeń. Jednak okazało się, że dla MT nie było to
takie proste, nawet po podaniu kontekstu.</p>
<p>I tak oto „murder of crows” stało się „morderstwem wron”, „pride of lions” –
„dumą lwów” a „stand of flamingos” – „stojakiem na flamingi”. Dla
niewtajemniczonych: murder, pride i stand w odniesieniu do ww. zwierząt to po
prostu stare dobre polskie „stado”.</p>
<p>Można powiedzieć, że takie „kwiatki” serwowane przez Google Translate (GT)
wychodzą bez kontekstu, ale po podaniu kontekstu wcale nie jest lepiej:</p>
<p>“A stand of flamingos flew over the lake” wg GT oznacza, że: „Nad jeziorem
przeleciało stoisko flamingów” [prawidłowo: stado flamingów]</p>
<p>Nie tylko Google Translate, ale każdy system tłumaczący ma problemy z
nietypowymi wyrażeniami. Czasem maszyna tłumaczy tekst odwrotnie niż się
spodziewamy.</p>
<p>I tak oto „mint state” wg GT to „stan miętowy” [prawidłowo: stan idealny]</p>
<p>Natomiast „mint condition” [termin nieco zmieniony] wg GT to już „stan menniczy”</p>
<p>A „car in a mint state/condition” [po podaniu kontekstu] wg GT to „auto w
opłakanym stanie” [prawidłowo: w stanie idealnym]</p>
<p>A ten sam termin, tylko w innym kontekście w tłumaczeniu wygląda tak: „the book
was in a mint state” wg GT oznacza: „książka była w stanie idealnym”</p>
<p>To wyrażenie zostało akurat prawidłowo przetłumaczone. Ale, jak zaznaczył
prelegent, problemem jest to, że wiele błędnych tłumaczeń figuruje w GT jako
tłumaczenia zatwierdzone przez społeczność.</p>
<p>Przykładowo „capital crime” wg GT to „przestępstwo kapitałowe” [prawidłowo:
przestępstwo zagrożone karą śmierci]</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="co-z-tym-sparrowem">Co z tym Sparrowem?<a href="https://techwriter.pl/Konferencja%20T%C5%82umaczy%202023%20-%20relacja#co-z-tym-sparrowem" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Co z tym Sparrowem?" title="Bezpośredni link do Co z tym Sparrowem?">​</a></h3>
<p>Parafrazując wypowiedź jednego ze swoich ulubionych bohaterów, czyli Jacka
Sparrowa z „Piratów z Karaibów”, prelegent zadał takie oto pytanie: „What MT can
do, and what MT can’t do?”</p>
<p>Zapewnił uczestników, że nie jest przeciwnikiem ani AI, ani MT, bo w wielu
przypadkach mogą okazać się przydatne. Jeśli bardziej stawiamy na użyteczność, a
nie na jakość, to tłumaczenie mechaniczne jest przydatne i daje akceptowalne
wyniki. Problem pojawia się wtedy, gdy tłumaczenie mechaniczne się nie sprawdza.</p>
<p>Jak w przytoczonych przez Janusza przykładach pochodzących z systemu
specjalistycznego szkolonego do tłumaczenia gier, a konkretnie sekcji szkolonej
do tłumaczenia gier wyścigowych.</p>
<p>I tak:</p>
<p>„Epic Games Support” wg systemu to „Obsługa epickich gier” [prawidłowo: Obsługa
związana ze sklepem Epic Games]</p>
<p>„UK (Italian, Iranian, Jamaican)” wg systemu to „Wielka Brytania (włoski,
irański, zuchwiany)”</p>

<p>– Czasem, gdy robię postediting, to mam wrażenie, że jestem bohaterem powieści
Stanisława Lema – zwierzył się prelegent. Miał na myśli książkę Stanisława Lema
pt. „Eden”, w której ziemski statek rozbija się na planecie, gdzie żyje
cywilizacja, z którą ludzie próbują się porozumieć. Następuje to za pomocą
tłumaczącego komputera zwanego kalkulatorem. Przekłada on słowa opierając się na
tzw. widmie semantycznym (jak sobie to wówczas wyobrażał Lem). Czyli w słowach
jest schowane znaczenie tych słów. Kosmonauci z planety Ziemia przełączają się
na kalkulatora w tzw. tryb poliwalencyjny. Tryb ten oznacza, że kiedy brak jest
w słowniku kalkulatora słowa, którego widmo znaczeniowe odpowiada temu z
oryginału, to on takie słowo zbuduje na podstawie tego widma.</p>
<p>Jaki jest tego efekt? Otóż taki:</p>
<p>„Dubelt praca fizyczna nie. Pauza. Organ elektryczny praca tak, ale
akceleroinwolucja degeneracja nadużycie. Pauza. Południe to egzemplifikacja
prokrustyki samosterownej pauza. Biosocjozwarcie antyśmierć pauza. Izolacja
społeczna nie siła, nie przymus, pauza. Dobrowolność pauza. Mikroadaptacja grupy
centrosamociąg produkcja tak nie pauza.”</p>
<p>– Lem wszystko przewidział, ponieważ sztuczna inteligencja robi podobne rzeczy z
polskim tekstem – podsumowuje prelegent. Chociaż nie wiadomo, dlaczego, bo nie
powinno się tak dziać. Nastąpił wielki postęp w generowaniu obrazów przez AI.
Tworzy ona wizerunki ludzi, których nie można odróżnić od zwykłych zdjęć. Np.
zdjęcie papieża z kosmitami, myśliwych z upolowanym gorylem gigantem, mutantów
itp. wyglądają jak autentyczne fotografie. Oczywiście pod warunkiem, że nie
widać rąk, stóp, ani zębów. Bo AI nie radzi sobie dobrze z generowaniem tych
części ciała.</p>
<p>Przykładowo:</p>
<p>„Soft cap” wg MT to „Miękkie kręciki” [chodzi o wartość progową, którą można
przekroczyć w grze, czyli limit]</p>
<p>„engine breaking” wg MT to „łamanie silnika” [chodzi o hamowanie silnikiem, co
człowiek będzie wiedział]</p>
<p>W powyższych przykładach widać wyższość człowieka nad AI, ponieważ AI nie zawsze
zauważy, że jest jakiś błąd w tekście. Słowa się zgadzają, ale tutaj
chodzi o hamowanie silnikiem, co człowiek będzie wiedział, a AI już nie.</p>
<p>W przypadku dłuższych tekstów jest jeszcze gorzej.</p>
<p>„Devon was an easy target whenever they got into a scrape with one another.” Wg
MT oznacza to, że: „Devon był łatwym celem, gdy wjechał w szrapkę ze sobą.”
[chodzi o to, gdy się ze sobą kłócili, były między nimi tarcia]</p>
<p>„Stillwater Designs” wg MT to „Wzory w nadalwaterze” [chodzi o nazwę własną
firmy]</p>
<p>Jest to słowotwórstwo, które miesza jedno z drugim.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="im-dalej-od-angielszczyzny-tym-gorzej">Im dalej od angielszczyzny, tym gorzej<a href="https://techwriter.pl/Konferencja%20T%C5%82umaczy%202023%20-%20relacja#im-dalej-od-angielszczyzny-tym-gorzej" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Im dalej od angielszczyzny, tym gorzej" title="Bezpośredni link do Im dalej od angielszczyzny, tym gorzej">​</a></h3>
<p>– W obszarze języka angielskiego jest jeszcze spokojnie. Jak w parze językowej
nie ma angielszczyzny, to AI niestety mocno głupieje – mówił prelegent.
Spójrzmy na przykład tłumaczenia maszynowego innych języków.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="MT_other_lngs" src="https://techwriter.pl/assets/images/MT_other_lngs-6065b8a92fb02de0a1b9a3d8781fc9e1.PNG" width="1602" height="691" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Jak się okazuje problematyczne dla MT jest też tłumaczenie tytułów obrazów, czy
z języka angielskiego czy innych języków.</p>
<p>I tak „Original sin” Salvadora Dali wg MT to „Oryginalny bez”</p>
<p>„La Belle Dame Sans Merci” Franka Cadogana Cowpera (1926) wg MT to „Piękna dama
bez podziękowania” [prawidłowo: Piękna pani bezlitosna, bo „sans merci” oznacza
„bez litości”]</p>
<p>– AI nie łapie tła kulturowego. Jest to niezrozumiałe, bo żeby złapać tło
kulturowe wystarczyłoby, żeby AI „przeczytała” Wikipedię, bo tam prawie wszystko
jest – dodał prelegent.</p>

<p>Na tym polu wcale nie jest lepiej. Szyk w zdaniu jest zaburzony, pojawiają się
niejasności czy dwuznaczności. Interpunkcja jest niewłaściwa. W teście źródłowym
mamy synonimy, a w tekście tłumaczenia zostało użyte to samo słowo. Konstrukcja
jest nieskładna. AI nie wyłapuje skrótów myślowych.</p>
<p>„Lando był jednym z tych kierowców, którzy wyrzeźli szuler przez scenę kartingu
[prawidłowo: wybili się albo przebili się w kartingu], zbierając tytuły przez
garstek [prawidłowo: całą garścią], podczas gdy w dużej mierze brakuje ogona ich
szkoły [prawidłowo: ominęli większość końcówki swojego szkolenia], gdy płakali
[prawidłowo: śmigając] przez Europę.”</p>
<p>A tekst oryginalny brzmiał tak:</p>
<p>„Lando was one of those drivers who carved a swathe through the karting scene,
gathering titles by the handful while largely missing the tail end of their
schooling as they criss-crossed Europe.”</p>

<p>Prelegent postawił tezę, że MT jest stosowane tam, do czego się jeszcze nie
nadaje. - Jestem przekonany, że będzie się nadawać, może trochę później niż chcą
entuzjaści, ale będzie – dodał. Jest to kwestia odpowiedniego skomplikowania
silników tłumaczących.</p>
<p>Dla zilustrowania jego tezy:</p>
<p>„He dug deep for that performance.” wg MT oznacza to, że: „Dupnął głęboko po tym
występie.” [prawidłowo: Sięgnął głęboko, żeby jechać tak dobrze.]</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="wyższość-człowieka-nad-maszyną">Wyższość człowieka nad maszyną<a href="https://techwriter.pl/Konferencja%20T%C5%82umaczy%202023%20-%20relacja#wy%C5%BCszo%C5%9B%C4%87-cz%C5%82owieka-nad-maszyn%C4%85" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Wyższość człowieka nad maszyną" title="Bezpośredni link do Wyższość człowieka nad maszyną">​</a></h3>
<p>W czym się ona przejawia? Czego maszyna nie widzi, co łatwo może dostrzec
człowiek? Otóż, jak przekonywał Janusz, maszyna nie rozumie kontekstu (np.
dostajemy takie tłumaczenie z gry golf: „… naucz się atakować każdą dziurę jak
profesjonalista” [„hole” w golfie to „dołek”, nie „dziura”), kolokwializmów (np.
„spring cleaning” wg MT to „wiosna – czyszczenie sprężyn” [zamiast „wiosenne
porządki”]), metafor (np. zdanie „Put one in the back of the net!” w tłumaczeniu
maszynowym brzmi: „Włóż jedną z tyłu siatki!” [a powinno brzmieć: „Wpakuj piłkę
do siatki”]) czy tła kulturowego (np. tytuł obrazu Gian Lorenzo Berniniego „Ill
ratto di Proserpina” w tłumaczeniu maszynowym brzmi: „Szczur Proserpina” [a
powinno brzmieć: „Porwanie Proserpiny”]).</p>
<p>AI trzeba nauczyć kolokwializmów, metafor itp., żeby można było ją stosować. -
Skoro ona tego nie umie, to nie należy jej stosować jeszcze i forsować, żeby
tłumacze robili postedycję. – stwierdził prelegent.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="co-możemy-z-tym-zrobić">Co możemy z tym zrobić?<a href="https://techwriter.pl/Konferencja%20T%C5%82umaczy%202023%20-%20relacja#co-mo%C5%BCemy-z-tym-zrobi%C4%87" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Co możemy z tym zrobić?" title="Bezpośredni link do Co możemy z tym zrobić?">​</a></h3>
<p>Niestety niewiele. Działa tu czynnik ekonomiczny, bo tłumaczenie mechaniczne
jest szybsze i tańsze od tłumaczenia wykonanego przez człowieka. Będzie gorsze,
a czasem w ogóle nie będzie mieć sensu, ale jest to rzecz drugorzędna. Firmy
dążą do maksymalizacji zysków i pieniędzy poprzez cięcie kosztów.</p>
<p>Na koniec prelegent przedstawił smutną wizję losu tłumaczy, którzy zostaną
sprowadzeni do roli poprawiaczy MTP. Nie miał złudzeń, że prędzej czy później
tak się stanie. A z tłumaczy pisemnych ostaną się tylko tłumacze literatury
pięknej, wysokiej, niszowej, beletrystyki, poezji. Ich sztuczna inteligencja
jeszcze długo nie zastąpi.</p>
<p>Janusz sugerował, że możemy spróbować obrócić to na naszą korzyść. Czyli zacząć
samemu wykorzystywać AI do pomocy w naszej pracy, do przyspieszenia jej. Chociaż
większość z nas już to robi – bo używa CAT-ów, które pomagają w tłumaczeniu
mechanicznym. Do CAT-ów można podłączać pluginy (mówił o tym Agenor w swoim
wystąpieniu w odniesieniu do Tradosa i OpenAI Translator).</p>
<p>Na koniec prelegent przytoczył takie przysłowie indiańskie, które mówi: „Jeśli
nie możesz kogoś pokonać, przyłącz się do niego”. Jest to pragmatyczne
podsumowanie wystąpienia.</p>

<p>Kolejne wystąpienie, które było bardziej dyskusją między uczestnikami i
prowadzącymi niż suchą prelekcją, oscylowało wokół tematu sztucznej inteligencji
i tego, czy AI jest zagrożeniem dla tłumaczy przysięgłych. Dlaczego zawód
tłumacza ustnego nie wyginie w obliczu nowinek technologicznych?</p>
<p>Opinie dyskutujących były podzielone. Byli tacy, którzy twierdzili, że AI
zastąpi tłumaczy (ba, to już się dzieje), inni przeciwstawiali się temu
twierdząc, że żywego tłumacza maszyna nigdy nie zastąpi, byli też tacy, którzy
widzieli przyszłość we współpracy tłumacza z „maszynką” jak żartobliwie
określali silnik do tłumaczenia maszynowego.</p>
<p>Zachęcając do dyskusji prelegenci stawiali przed sobą i uczestnikami pytania,
którym przyglądamy się poniżej.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="żywy-tłumacz--bo-człowiek-może-więcej">Żywy tłumacz – bo człowiek może więcej?<a href="https://techwriter.pl/Konferencja%20T%C5%82umaczy%202023%20-%20relacja#%C5%BCywy-t%C5%82umacz--bo-cz%C5%82owiek-mo%C5%BCe-wi%C4%99cej" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Żywy tłumacz – bo człowiek może więcej?" title="Bezpośredni link do Żywy tłumacz – bo człowiek może więcej?">​</a></h3>
<p>Zastanawiano się, co to znaczy „może więcej”?</p>
<p>Czy to znaczy, że może więcej ilościowo czy jakościowo? Jaka jest wartość dodana
człowieka w zestawieniu go z maszyną? Dotyczy to oczywiście tłumaczeń ustnych.
Czy człowiek może więcej w kontekście tłumaczeń ustnych niż maszyna?</p>
<p>Wypowiadający się uczestnicy byli zgodni co do tego, że maszyna będzie lepsza od
człowieka pod względem ilościowym – czyli jeśli chodzi np. o liczbę słów
tłumaczonych na godzinę. Ma większy zasięg, jest łatwiej dostępna, może dotrzeć
do większej liczby osób, które nie mają środków, aby inwestować w tłumaczy. Z
maszyny można skorzystać tu i teraz, gdy człowiek jest w trudnej sytuacji, a pod
ręką ma tylko komórkę.</p>
<p>Jednak pod względem jakościowym, na chwilę obecną, jeśli chodzi o język polski,
to maszyna nie będzie lepsza od człowieka. Nie będzie też wiedziała, czy
wypowiedź człowieka stojącego na scenie (którego tłumacz tłumaczy) można
przełożyć dokładnie tak, jak ona wybrzmiała. Czy publiczność nie zostanie
przypadkiem obrażona. Bo dosłowne tłumaczenie może prowadzić do problemów nawet
na skalę polityczną. W tym momencie maszyna może więcej, ale wcale nie lepiej.</p>
<p>Pojawiły się też głosy, że idealną sytuacją by było, gdyby tłumacz był wspierany
przez maszynę. Bo chociaż możemy być świetnymi tłumaczami, każdy może mieć
gorszy dzień, każdy może nie zdążyć pojawić się na tłumaczeniu, a każdy ma prawo
do dobrego tłumaczenia. I z uwagi na to tłumaczenie przez człowieka powinno iść
w parze z tłumaczeniem maszynowym.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tłumacz-w-sądzie-i-w-prokuraturze--bo-język-prawa-nie-jest-łatwy">Tłumacz w sądzie i w prokuraturze – bo język prawa nie jest łatwy?<a href="https://techwriter.pl/Konferencja%20T%C5%82umaczy%202023%20-%20relacja#t%C5%82umacz-w-s%C4%85dzie-i-w-prokuraturze--bo-j%C4%99zyk-prawa-nie-jest-%C5%82atwy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Tłumacz w sądzie i w prokuraturze – bo język prawa nie jest łatwy?" title="Bezpośredni link do Tłumacz w sądzie i w prokuraturze – bo język prawa nie jest łatwy?">​</a></h3>
<p>Prowadzący rozpoczęli tę część dyskusji od tego, że istnieją języki, które mają
dużo różnych wariantów. Albo są pełne dialektów i np. w każdej wsi w danym kraju mówi
się inaczej. Tak więc jeśli tłumacz zna dany język, to zna też powiązane z nim
konteksty historyczne, kulturowe, dialekty czy warianty, to taki tłumacz „może
więcej”. A silnik czy telefon użyty do tłumaczenia maszynowego może wyrządzić
więcej szkody niż pożytku takiej osobie, która potrzebuje pomocy czy to w sądzie
czy w prokuraturze.</p>
<p>Bo maszyna, nawet najbardziej inteligentna nie wyjaśni i nie pomoże zrozumieć
temu, komu tłumaczy albo kogo tłumaczy zawiłej formułki prawniczej czy terminów
specjalistycznych. Czasem terminologia specjalistyczna wymaga sparafrazowania,
opowiedzenia. Trudno maszynę wytrenować w takim zakresie i dostarczyć jej takie
dane wejściowe. Wbrew temu, co niektórzy sugerowali, że maszynę można „nakarmić”
danymi wejściowymi typu konteksty kulturowe, historyczne czy dialekty.</p>
<p>Ponadto zdarzają się sytuacje, że język, którym posługuje się dana osoba nie
jest nawet czystym dialektem, tylko czymś pomiędzy językiem ojczystym a językiem
kraju jej zamieszkania. Albo połączeniem 3 języków sąsiadujących ze sobą krajów.
Często jest to niezrozumiałe nawet dla samego tłumacza. A tym bardziej byłoby to
dla maszyny. A dodatkowo, jeśli chodzi o języki rzadsze, to musimy jeszcze długo
zaczekać, zanim maszyny nauczą się je dobrze tłumaczyć. Może radzą sobie z
prostym angielskim, ewentualnie chińskim, rosyjskim czy hiszpańskim. Ale nie
poradzą sobie z dialektem np. Turków pochodzenia bułgarskiego, którzy mówią
specyficznym bardzo prostym dialektem.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tłumacz-na-policji--bo-można-coś-przekręcić">Tłumacz na policji – bo można coś przekręcić?<a href="https://techwriter.pl/Konferencja%20T%C5%82umaczy%202023%20-%20relacja#t%C5%82umacz-na-policji--bo-mo%C5%BCna-co%C5%9B-przekr%C4%99ci%C4%87" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Tłumacz na policji – bo można coś przekręcić?" title="Bezpośredni link do Tłumacz na policji – bo można coś przekręcić?">​</a></h3>
<p>Przy tym pytaniu pojawiły się opinie, że maszyna czasem przekręca i tłumaczy na
odwrót. Może dojść do kuriozalnych sytuacji, gdy podczas przesłuchania na
policji padnie pytanie ze strony śledczego: Ukradłeś? Na co podejrzany odpowie:
Nie. A maszyna przetłumaczy: Tak.</p>
<p>Nawiązano też do kwestii empatii w trakcie tłumaczenia. Pytano, czy empatia np.
podczas trudnych tłumaczeń zeznań ofiar przestępstw jest potrzebna. Bo ważne
jest, aby tak przetłumaczyć terminologię używaną przez funkcjonariuszy, żeby to
nie brzmiało bezosobowo i instrumentalnie. Bo ofiara nie jest przygotowana na
taki suchy i bezosobowy przekaz. Empatia okazana przez drugiego człowieka jest
wtedy potrzeba. I jeszcze bardzo długo będzie.</p>
<p>Wbrew zarzutom niektórych uczestników nie jest to ingerencja, tylko tłumaczenie
na poziomie lingwistycznym. Chodzi o dobieranie kilku dostępnych odpowiedników w
języku, na który tłumaczymy. Nie chodzi tutaj o bawienie się w psychologa, tylko
odpowiednie dobieranie słów. Trzeba mieć z tyłu głowy, że obok siedzi żywa
osoba, która jest zapłakana, rozedrgana, niekoniecznie jest przygotowana na
generowany przez maszynę bezosobowy język, który nie będzie empatyczny.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tłumacz-na-granicy--bo-w-tłumaczeniu-są-emocje">Tłumacz na granicy – bo w tłumaczeniu są emocje?<a href="https://techwriter.pl/Konferencja%20T%C5%82umaczy%202023%20-%20relacja#t%C5%82umacz-na-granicy--bo-w-t%C5%82umaczeniu-s%C4%85-emocje" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Tłumacz na granicy – bo w tłumaczeniu są emocje?" title="Bezpośredni link do Tłumacz na granicy – bo w tłumaczeniu są emocje?">​</a></h3>
<p>– To, czego maszyna na pewno nie ma to empatia, której maszyna w sytuacji
tłumaczeń wywołujących duże emocje nie okaże – stwierdził jeden z uczestników.</p>
<p>Tu jest przewaga człowieka nad maszyną. Maszyny nie można nakarmić wyczuciem
stanu emocjonalnego, tym, w jakim stanie psychicznym jest np. osoba, która jest
przesłuchiwana w prokuraturze, nawet w charakterze świadka. Bo dla wielu osób
jest to ogromny stres i tym osobom trzeba wytłumaczyć w jakiej sytuacji się
znalazły.</p>
<p>Pojawiły się głosy, że oczywiście maszyna nie odczuwa empatii, ale też nikt od
niej tego nie oczekuje. A nawet jeśli, to patrząc na rozwój technologiczny jest
to kwestia miesięcy, żeby maszyna się tego nauczyła. Od 2015 roku firmy uczą
maszyny rozpoznawać emocje. To nie jest kwestia paru lat. To już teraz się
dzieje. A poza tym, jeśli maszyna nie ma empatii, to nie ma też stronniczości
politycznej.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tłumacz-w-kontekstach-tajne-przez-poufne--bo-sekretów-trzeba-strzec">Tłumacz w kontekstach tajne przez poufne – bo sekretów trzeba strzec?<a href="https://techwriter.pl/Konferencja%20T%C5%82umaczy%202023%20-%20relacja#t%C5%82umacz-w-kontekstach-tajne-przez-poufne--bo-sekret%C3%B3w-trzeba-strzec" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Tłumacz w kontekstach tajne przez poufne – bo sekretów trzeba strzec?" title="Bezpośredni link do Tłumacz w kontekstach tajne przez poufne – bo sekretów trzeba strzec?">​</a></h3>
<p>Przy tym pytaniu zastanawiano się, co z danymi poufnymi, którymi zostanie
nakarmiona „maszynka”. Bo są informacje (np. tajemnice państwowe), które nie
mogą wydostać się poza krąg danych osób. I człowiek sobie z tym radzi. A jak ma
wyglądać w takim kontekście zastosowanie takiej maszyny.</p>
<p>Pojawiły się głosy, że trudno sobie wyobrazić, aby rozmowy dyplomatyczne były
tłumaczone przez maszynę. Bo tłumaczenia na najwyższym szczeblu muszą być
wykonywane przez ludzi z uwagi na to, że ludzie mogą wyłapać kontekst. I często
dzięki tłumaczom właśnie nie dochodzi do skandali właśnie np. dyplomatycznych.</p>
<p>Wspomniano też o tajemnicy adwokackiej. Bo tłumaczone jest nie tylko
przesłuchanie, ale też rozmowy adwokata z oskarżonym. Adwokat ustalający np.
strategię obrony z klientem nie będzie chętny do korzystania z maszyny do
tłumaczenia. Bo strony wymieniają między sobą informacje, które nie powinny
nigdzie wypłynąć.</p>
<p>Pojawiły się głosy, że nie będzie możliwości, aby maszyny zastąpiły tłumaczy w
miejscach, gdzie nie ma Internetu. Jest to podstawowy problem przy tłumaczeniach
online – czy jest Internet? Natomiast jeśli chodzi o tłumaczenia tajne, to nikt
w takiej sytuacji nie dopuści do tego, żeby był Internet. Zwłaszcza, że przy
takich tłumaczeniach podejmowane są wszelkie środki ostrożności – zostawia się
komórki w innej sali, osoby mające uczestniczyć w spotkaniu są przeszukiwanie, a
dopiero potem są wpuszczane na salę właściwą.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="to-co-z-tymi-maszynami-mającymi-zastąpić-człowieka">To co z tymi maszynami mającymi zastąpić człowieka?<a href="https://techwriter.pl/Konferencja%20T%C5%82umaczy%202023%20-%20relacja#to-co-z-tymi-maszynami-maj%C4%85cymi-zast%C4%85pi%C4%87-cz%C5%82owieka" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do To co z tymi maszynami mającymi zastąpić człowieka?" title="Bezpośredni link do To co z tymi maszynami mającymi zastąpić człowieka?">​</a></h3>
<p>Jak stwierdził jeden z uczestników, maszyny nie zastąpią całkowicie tłumaczy.
Będzie raczej następować ich separacja, czyli do danej sytuacji, do konkretnego zakresu wykorzystane będzie albo jedno albo drugie. Powstaje pytanie, na ile ludzie, nie tłumacze,
tylko ludzie korzystający z usług tłumaczy będą chcieli rozmawiać z maszyną.
Przy jakich tekstach czy w jakich kontekstach będą chcieli używać maszyny do
tłumaczenia.</p>
<p>– Takie porównanie: były tramwaje w mieście, potem ich nie było, a
potem powróciły, bo się okazało, że są potrzebne, więc może bez tych naszych
tramwajów tłumaczeniowych też się obyć nie będzie można – dodał na koniec.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="podsumowanie">Podsumowanie<a href="https://techwriter.pl/Konferencja%20T%C5%82umaczy%202023%20-%20relacja#podsumowanie" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Podsumowanie" title="Bezpośredni link do Podsumowanie">​</a></h2>
<p>Konferencja przebiegała w sympatycznej i przyjaznej atmosferze. Dyskusje, które
toczyły się w salach prelekcyjnych można było przenieść w warunki bardziej
nieformalne do jednego z warszawskich pubów, gdzie uczestnicy spotkali się po
konferencji. Była to okazja do spędzenia czasu z kolegami i koleżankami z
branży, wymiany doświadczeń zawodowych, porozmawiania na luźniejsze tematy, czy
po prostu do miłego spędzenia czasu w gronie znajomych, z którymi nie ma się
kontaktu osobistego na co dzień.</p>
<p>Niektórzy patrzą z niepokojem w przyszłość i zastanawiają się, czy nie staną się
przeżytkami w dobie tłumaczenia maszynowego i coraz szerszych zastosowań
sztucznej inteligencji. Jednak gros tłumaczy jest zgodne co do tego, że
maszyny ich tak szybko nie zastąpią.</p>
<p>Są one z nami od jakiegoś czasu, ale stosunkowo jest to nowość, tak jak kiedyś
CAT-y (czyli narzędzia wspomagające tłumaczenie), co do których również obawiano
się, że zastąpią tłumaczy. A tymczasem, jak sama nazwa na to wskazuje, ich
zadaniem było pomóc tłumaczom w ich pracy. Zwłaszcza przy wielostronicowych
powtarzalnych dokumentach jak np. instrukcje obsługi. Ale nigdy nie zastąpiły
one człowieka.</p>
<p>Tak samo w przypadku tłumaczenia maszynowego czy AI. Mogą pomóc w pracy
tłumacza, ale istnieją sytuacje i konteksty, w których maszyna nie będzie lepsza
od człowieka. Albo nie będzie wskazane jej użycie. Dlatego tłumacze mogą spać
spokojnie, przynajmniej przez kilkanaście kolejnych lat.</p>]]></content>

<p>Tym razem spotkaliśmy się w <strong>Dolby Laboratories</strong>, a meetup odbył się pod
hasłem: <em>AI/ML/NLP exploration at Dolby Technical Communications</em>. Wrześniowa
prelegentka,
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marta-bartnicka-713969/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Marta Bartnicka</strong></a>,
która w Dolby pracuje jako <em>Staff Engineer</em> w obszarze Publishing and
Localization, opowiadała o rzeczach, o których można śmiało powiedzieć - nie
śniło się tech writerom! 😉</p>
<p>Marta zaczęła z dużą dawką humoru, robiąc przegląd ostatnich virali i memów z
obszaru AI. Potem było już tylko lepiej 😁</p>
<p>Dowiedzieliśmy się o kontekście, w jakim powstaje dokumentacja w Dolby. Firma ma
bardzo konkretne ograniczeniach i wymagania, według których należy tworzyć i
utrzymywać dokumentację techniczną. Większość dokumentacji nie jest publicznie
dostępna i opisuje technologie stanowiące własność intelektualną firmy.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ai">AI<a href="https://techwriter.pl/meet-content-wro-pazdziernik-2023#ai" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do AI" title="Bezpośredni link do AI">​</a></h3>
<p>W kolejnej części Marta wyjaśniła pojęcie sieci neuronowej oraz podkreśliła
fakt, że sztuczna inteligencja jedynie przetwarza informacje, którymi ją
‘nakarmiono’. Innymi słowy, <em>no input, no output</em>.</p>
<p>Dowiedzieliśmy się, że Komisja Europejska opracowuje
<a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Artificial Intelligence Act</a>, który ma
na celu między innymi zwiększenie transparentności danych używanych do szkolenia
AI. Rozważane jest również nałożenie obowiązku oznaczania treści wygenerowanych
przez AI.</p>

<p>Marta zaprezentowała zgromadzonym wtyczkę dostępną w Oxygen CMS,
<a href="https://blog.oxygenxml.com/topics/ai_positron.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI Positron</a>, której
możliwości zelektryzowały zgromadzonych. AI Positron działa - póki co - na bazie
ChatGPT 3.5. Oto tylko niektóre z możliwości, które oferuje:</p>
<ul>
<li>Opcja <em>Continue writing</em> umożliwiająca generowanie tekstu rozwijającego myśl,
którą zapisaliśmy</li>
<li>Generowanie pytań do danego fragmentu tekstu czy artykułu</li>
<li>Sugestie językowe i stylistyczne oraz podnoszące wskaźnik czytelności tekstu</li>
<li>Opcja zmiany paragrafu w instrukcję, jeśli zawiera elementy procedury</li>
</ul>
<p>Jednak uzbrojeni w kontekst specyficzny dla Dolby, który Marta opisała na
początku, wiedzieliśmy że narzędzie to nie sprawdzi się w każdej firmie, choć AI
Positron ma niedługo umożliwiać wybór różnych AI, np.
<a href="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-chatgpt-enterprise" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ChatGPT Enterprise</a>, w
którym podobno dane wsadowe nie będą używane do dalszego szkolenia algorytmu.</p>
<p>W Dolby jednak wybrano inną ścieżkę…</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ai-i-nlp">AI i NLP<a href="https://techwriter.pl/meet-content-wro-pazdziernik-2023#ai-i-nlp" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do AI i NLP" title="Bezpośredni link do AI i NLP">​</a></h3>
<p>Marta opowiedziała nam o kilku wewnętrznych projektach, które bazują na innej
platformie AI, i o bardziej klasycznych rozwiązaniach przetwarzania języka
naturalnego (NLP). Te eksperymentalne projekty mają na celu między innymi:</p>
<ul>
<li>Znalezienie optymalnego sposobu pozyskiwania poprawnych odpowiedzi z zasobów
wiedzy zgromadzonych w Dolby</li>
<li>Identyfikowanie zduplikowanych lub bardzo podobnych treści poprzez analizę
istniejącej dokumentacji</li>
<li>Wsparcie twórców treści poprzez wykrywanie typowych błędów stylistycznych i
sugerowanie zmian</li>
</ul>
<p>Dolby tworzy wewnętrzny ekosystem, w którym pracownicy mogą się szkolić w prompt
engineeringu, a narzędzia AI będą oceniane i rozwijane na podstawie informacji
zwrotnej: <em>prawda - fałsz</em>. A wszystko to bez wychodzenia poza domenę Dolby.</p>
<p>Prezentacja Marty zdecydowanie była mocnym wejściem w kolejny sezon
MeetContentWRO! 💪</p>
<p>Dziękujemy za udział i widzimy się <strong>25 października</strong> w <strong>Text</strong>!</p>

<p>Każde ze spotkań ma na celu pogłębianie wiedzy uczestników, wymianę doświadczeń
i ciekawych pomysłów z szeroko pojętej branży tworzenia treści.</p>
<p>Rozumiemy, że nie wszyscy jesteśmy obdarzeni prężnym zespołem, który tworzy
społeczność praktyków w naszych dziedzinach, dlatego staramy się stać czymś tego
rodzaju, aby wypełnić tę lukę.</p>
<p>Po każdym spotkaniu następuje część nieformalna, dzięki czemu wszyscy uczestnicy
mają czas na zadawanie pytań, dyskusję lub po prostu nawiązanie kontaktów.</p>

<p>Organizatorom zależy, by spotkania były istotne i przybliżały tematy, które są
dla Was interesujące. Możecie zgłosić temat, a my dołożymy wszelkich starań, aby
znaleźć prelegentów, którzy będą mogli o nim porozmawiać. Możecie także sami
zostać prelegentami na jednym z naszych spotkań.</p>]]></content>
