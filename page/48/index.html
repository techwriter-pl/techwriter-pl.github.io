w firmie TomTom. Urodziła się w Stanach Zjednoczonych, mieszkała przez 15 lat w
Szkocji, obecnie przebywa w Holandii. W ramach swojej roli w TomTomie uczy
nowego podejścia do dokumentowania. Dzięki jej staraniom kolejne osoby angażują
się w sprawy dotyczące dokumentacji. Spędziła sporo czasu w łódzkim biurze
TomToma, ale wciąż po polsku nie potrafi powiedzieć wiele więcej niż &quot;tak&quot;,
&quot;nie&quot;, &quot;dzień dobry&quot; i oczywiście &quot;dziękuję&quot;.</p><p>Zapraszamy!</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-long-have-you-been-working-as-an-information-architect">How long have you been working as an Information Architect?<a href="#how-long-have-you-been-working-as-an-information-architect" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do How long have you been working as an Information Architect?" title="Bezpośredni link do How long have you been working as an Information Architect?">​</a></h4><p>I’ve been in this role for a little over four years. But I’ve been writing for
work on the side for much longer. Whenever anyone’s needed something polished,
or been unable to express themselves clearly in a crucial document, they’ve come
to me.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-did-you-become-an-information-architect">How did you become an Information Architect?<a href="#how-did-you-become-an-information-architect" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do How did you become an Information Architect?" title="Bezpośredni link do How did you become an Information Architect?">​</a></h4><p>It wasn’t a normal way of getting the job. But TomTom is not always a normal
company.</p><p>What happened was that I saw that documentation was a big problem in my
organizational unit. Our company culture encourages people to speak up when they
see a problem, and when possible to find ways to solve it. So I spoke up, and
helped when I could (I did have a different job to do after all).</p><p>After a while, the leadership team in my department decided to create the role
of Information Architect. Or, more properly, they decided to create a role with
the <em>title</em> of Information Architect. They didn’t really know how to describe
the problem, much less solve it. So my first task was to try to understand what
the problems were, even as I started solving them.</p><p>I didn’t have a job description for almost two years. Then I wrote my own.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="can-you-say-something-about-the-company-you-work-for-and-your-team">Can you say something about the company you work for and your team?<a href="#can-you-say-something-about-the-company-you-work-for-and-your-team" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Can you say something about the company you work for and your team?" title="Bezpośredni link do Can you say something about the company you work for and your team?">​</a></h4><p>TomTom is a tech company. We make software and maps for navigation applications,
mostly to run in cars. It’s a rarity in that it’s a European-owned tech company.
Although it’s been around since the last century, it still has a very start-up
mindset, encouraging people to take responsibility and start their own
initiatives when they see a gap. The result of that is that it’s also a very
fractal organization…quite often you find the same things being done or started
up in different areas as people see similar problems and try out their own ways
to solve them.</p><p>The writing world within TomTom is certainly like that. We have little clusters
of people throughout the organization that do various forms of writing, from map
specifications to documentation to strings inside applications. We’re starting
to get into better contact with one another in a Documentation Guild.</p><p>As for me, strictly speaking, I don’t have a team. There are no other technical
writers in my organizational unit. But I knew this was going to happen – there
wasn’t budget to hire a team of tech writers. So I started teaching my
colleagues how to write.</p><p>You could say that I don’t have a team, but considering how TomTom works, how
the Documentation Guild is growing, and how many people in my organizational
unit have learned to be writers at one level or another…I have a <em>community</em>.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-is-your-work-organized">How is your work organized?<a href="#how-is-your-work-organized" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do How is your work organized?" title="Bezpośredni link do How is your work organized?">​</a></h4><p>I organize my work myself. It falls roughly into three streams:</p><ul><li><strong>Reviewing and polishing technical writing done by my colleagues.</strong> Mostly
this takes the form of pull request reviews, because we do a lot of docs as
code (I’ll talk about this below), but it can also be things emailed to me.
These are generally small jobs, half an hour or so per piece. I try to keep
turnaround times very short so that I’m not a bottleneck on processes, partly
because if I make things harder, people will not involve me.</li><li><strong>Requested projects.</strong> Teams will ask me to write things or to organize
information. (The Information Architect role is about deciding how and where
things are stored, and the processes we use for producing documentation, as
well as technical writing itself.) These tend to last a few weeks, sometimes
taking all of the time I’m not using in reviewing and polishing, sometimes
taking a few hours a week at most. My goal there is to create sustainable
things – documents that teams can keep up to date themselves, processes and
tools that the teams own and understand.</li><li><strong>Long-term initiatives.</strong> My role is more than just fire-fighting. I’m trying
to put systems and processes in place that make writing easier and better. I
always have a couple of projects that I’m doing on the side to achieve that.
These are things I choose and prioritize myself. At the moment I’m doing the
last stages of cleaning up our enormous and chaotic Confluence space and
adapting the writing teaching that I used to do in person to online
instruction.</li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-tools-do-you-use-and-what-do-you-think-about-them">What tools do you use and what do you think about them?<a href="#what-tools-do-you-use-and-what-do-you-think-about-them" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do What tools do you use and what do you think about them?" title="Bezpośredni link do What tools do you use and what do you think about them?">​</a></h4><p>Because a lot of my work is about getting others to write, the tools I use have
to be ones that they can use as well. This excludes both specialist technical
writing protocols such as DITA and software with a high per-seat license cost.</p><p>We use a docs as code approach, which means that as much as possible, we use the
same processes to create and change documentation that we do to create and
change software. We keep a lot of our documentation in the repository and update
it with pull requests. This means we’re using a workflow that the teams already
understand, and that is already tooled up and maintained.</p><p>To do this, we keep our documentation in a markup language – AsciiDoc. One of my
first initiatives as an Information Architect was the selection exercise that
ended up with it. AsciiDoc can render documentation into a variety of formats,
including HTML and PDF. (It can even create Word documents if you’re willing to
hack a little.) I really like AsciiDoc, because it is both simple enough to work
with very directly and subtle enough to produce good outputs automatically.</p><p>The other thing I work with a lot is Confluence, which is our internal Wiki in
TomTom. It’s not a documentation format like AsciiDoc, but rather a publication
platform. It’s very feature-poor…simple, but in a bad way. The search
functionality is frustrating and hard to use well, and you often have to choose
between doing things <em>easily</em> and doing them <em>well</em>. That’s very painful.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-do-you-get-the-information-you-need-to-preparecreate-documentation">How do you get the information you need to prepare/create documentation?<a href="#how-do-you-get-the-information-you-need-to-preparecreate-documentation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do How do you get the information you need to prepare/create documentation?" title="Bezpośredni link do How do you get the information you need to prepare/create documentation?">​</a></h4><p>Since most of our documentation is written by the subject matter experts
themselves, I don’t need to do a lot of interrogation…excuse me, I mean
interviewing for that.</p><p>When I do need to get information for something I’m writing, I usually set up a
half-hour or hour meeting with the person, record it, and use very open
questions. I focus on understanding the background and key concepts before
jumping into the specifics. I keep the meeting light and friendly. Then when
I’ve written up what I’ve learned I send it to them and ask for comments.
There’s usually another half-hour meeting somewhere in there for clarifications
that go faster in person.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-documents-do-you-deliver-in-what-form-in-which-languagelanguages-and-how-are-they-published">What documents do you deliver, in what form, in which language/languages and how are they published?<a href="#what-documents-do-you-deliver-in-what-form-in-which-languagelanguages-and-how-are-they-published" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do What documents do you deliver, in what form, in which language/languages and how are they published?" title="Bezpośredni link do What documents do you deliver, in what form, in which language/languages and how are they published?">​</a></h4><ul><li>The main documents that I deliver, or contribute to the delivery of, are:</li><li>Product documentation in PDF form that is supplied alongside our software
development kits (SDKs).</li><li>Product documentation in HTML form for the online APIs on our Developer
Portal.</li><li>Microcopy (strings) for our apps, which appears in the apps themselves.</li><li>Process documentation for how we work, which is published on Confluence.</li><li>Educational materials such as slides, which I am currently migrating to a new
platform (see below).</li></ul><p>All of these are in English.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="do-you-participate-in-any-other-activities-besides-documentation-writing-eg-creation-of-marketing-materials-if-yes-what-is-it-and-what-tools-do-you-use">Do you participate in any other activities besides documentation writing (e.g. creation of marketing materials)?

If yes, what is it and what tools do you use?" title="Bezpośredni link do Do you participate in any other activities besides documentation writing (e.g. creation of marketing materials)? If yes, what is it and what tools do you use?">​</a></h4><p>I’ve mentioned it above, but there are two that I’d like to explain in more
detail.</p><ul><li>I write strings for our apps. This is done in Confluence, which is probably
the worst tool imaginable for the job, but it’s the one everyone in the
process has access to. This kind of writing – microcopy – is fascinating,
because it’s like poetry. Every single word carries a lot of weight, and has
to both give the user the right high-level information and teach/reinforce the
underlying mental models that they need to use the app easily. Oh, and it also
has to convey the right kind of friendly tone, and it has to be able to be
translated into lots of different languages! It’s a huge challenge.</li><li>The other thing I do that’s pretty far off of standard technical writing work
is teaching writing. Most of the people in TomTom are not native speakers of
English, but that is our language of communication. So I teach the basics of
technical writing. I was doing it in person to groups of people, using a
PowerPoint slide deck, but the world has changed. So now I’m creating
materials to use online – either slide decks or online exercises, to cater for
different learning styles. I’m doing it in AsciiDoc, because there’s a way to
create presentations with it (using reveal-js), but I can <em>also</em> use the same
material in webpages. And I’m keeping it all in a repository, so I don’t have
to worry about versioning.</li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-the-biggest-challenges-at-your-work">What are the biggest challenges at your work?<a href="#what-are-the-biggest-challenges-at-your-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do What are the biggest challenges at your work?" title="Bezpośredni link do What are the biggest challenges at your work?">​</a></h4><p>To be honest, the biggest challenge is the amount that I have to manage my own
work. That requires a lot of confidence that I’m making the right choices, and
that the work I’m doing is any good. Without a team around me, that all has to
come from me.</p><p>Most of the time, I trust my instincts, and those instincts are generally good
(or good enough, anyway.) But it’s definitely the hardest part of my job.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-do-you-like-the-most-in-technical-writing">What do you like the most in technical writing?<a href="#what-do-you-like-the-most-in-technical-writing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do What do you like the most in technical writing?" title="Bezpośredni link do What do you like the most in technical writing?">​</a></h4><p>The feeling when I take someone else’s writing where the <em>content</em> is good but
the expression is not clear, and turn it into simple, understandable writing.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-your-advice-for-those-who-want-to-begin-their-adventure-with-writing-documentation">What is your advice for those who want to begin their adventure with writing documentation?<a href="#what-is-your-advice-for-those-who-want-to-begin-their-adventure-with-writing-documentation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do What is your advice for those who want to begin their adventure with writing documentation?" title="Bezpośredni link do What is your advice for those who want to begin their adventure with writing documentation?">​</a></h4><p>I’m a terrible person to ask this of, because my path into technical writing was
so strange. But the one thing you really need to do to be a good technical
writer is be a good writer. So write! Write in your native language, write in
English. Read good writing, and ask yourself what makes it good.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-does-the-labor-market-look-like-for-tech-writers-in-the-netherlands-are-there-any-organizations-that-unite-technical-writers-in-the-netherlands">What does the labor market look like for Tech Writers in the Netherlands? Are there any organizations that unite Technical Writers in the Netherlands?<a href="#what-does-the-labor-market-look-like-for-tech-writers-in-the-netherlands-are-there-any-organizations-that-unite-technical-writers-in-the-netherlands" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do What does the labor market look like for Tech Writers in the Netherlands? Are there any organizations that unite Technical Writers in the Netherlands?" title="Bezpośredni link do What does the labor market look like for Tech Writers in the Netherlands? Are there any organizations that unite Technical Writers in the Netherlands?">​</a></h4><p>I won’t be able to give good answers about tech writing in the Netherlands. I
didn’t come to this by the straight path. But the place to go for these kinds of
questions is the
<a href="https://www.writethedocs.org/slack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Write The Docs community</a>, which is
worldwide and very, very friendly. I recommend them unconditionally. WTD is the
place to go. They do an annual salary survey, there’s a channel for tech writing
jobs, and there are tons of people who can answer questions about getting into
the business.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="do-you-have-any-diploma-or-certificate-in-technical-writing-if-yes-did-it-help-you-in-your-career">Do you have any diploma or certificate in technical writing?

If yes, did it help you in your career?" title="Bezpośredni link do Do you have any diploma or certificate in technical writing? If yes, did it help you in your career?">​</a></h4><p>No…I have a bachelor’s degree in classical Latin and a postgraduate certificate
in software technology. But I grew up in a household that spoke highly educated
English (both of my parents were lawyers). And I’ve been writing in various
ways, online and offline, throughout my life.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="do-you-have-an-idea-about-how-the-technical-writer-role-is-going-to-evolve-in-the-near-future-where-is-it-headed-and-what-are-the-biggest-trends-on-the-horizon">Do you have an idea about how the technical writer role is going to evolve in the near future?

Where is it headed, and what are the biggest trends on the horizon?" title="Bezpośredni link do Do you have an idea about how the technical writer role is going to evolve in the near future? Where is it headed, and what are the biggest trends on the horizon?">​</a></h4><p>I think that the trend of having subject matter experts write the first draft of
some documents is going to continue, and we need to work with that. Docs as Code
is here to stay, not just because it uses well-understood workflows but because
it’s flexible and portable.</p><p>But the most interesting thing on the horizon is video. So many teenagers and
young adults just entering the workforce prefer to get their content in video
form. At the moment, we don’t have good tools for creating and managing video
content, though one side-effect of the pandemic is that more people are getting
good at working with their webcams. Note that this doesn’t replace written
content – some people still prefer to read. It’s that we need to cater for a
wider range of ways of getting information.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="thank-you-for-your-insights">Thank you for your insights.<a href="#thank-you-for-your-insights" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Thank you for your insights." title="Bezpośredni link do Thank you for your insights.">​</a></h4></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tagi:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/warsztat">warsztat</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/wywiady">wywiady</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/dokumentacja">dokumentacja</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/spolecznosc">spolecznosc</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/wywiad">wywiad</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/tech-writer-koduje-odcinek-23">Tech Writer koduje odcinek 23</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2020-12-01T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">1 grudnia 2020</time> · <!-- -->2 min aby przeczytać</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://github.com/techwriter-pl.png" alt="Agnieszka Gaworska"><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><span itemprop="name">Agnieszka Gaworska</span></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Dziś kolejna odsłona podcastu

jest Rafał Pawlicki, specjalista do spraw dokumentacji technicznej z Krakowa.
Wraz z Michałem i Pawłem zastanawiają się w jaki sposób najlepiej zmierzyć
jakość dokumentacji oraz czym się kierować w jej ocenie.</p><p><strong>Jakość dokumentacji - czym jest?</strong></p><p>Rafał definiuje jakość dokumentacji w ten sposób - dobra dokumentacja to taka,
która spełnia wyznaczone przez użytkownika, korporację, producenta czy twórcę
standardy i da się ją sprawdzić za pomocą przyjętych metryk.</p><p>Rozmówcy zauważyli, że metryk jakości nie da się sprawdzić automatycznie biorąc
pod uwagę posiadane dane. Uważają, że można jedynie sprawdzić jej spójność z
przyjętymi w danej jednostce standardami.</p><p>W dalszej części materiału panowie zastanawiają się jak stworzyć najlepszą
dokumentację. Na podstawie własnych doświadczeń przyjęli w tym celu następujące
kroki:</p><ol><li>Ustalenie wewnętrznych standardów jakości, które są ściśle przestrzegane,</li><li>Kontrola jakości czyli sprawdzenie czy dokumentacja spełnia przyjęte cele,</li><li>Weryfikacja standardów czyli rozwijanie ich w taki sposób, by dokumentacja
która je spełniała była coraz lepsza.</li></ol><p>Niby proste, jednak jak utrzymywać wewnętrzne standardy jednocześnie ucząc ludzi
pisania dobrej dokumentacji? W jaki sposób mierzyć efektywność dokumentacji?</p><p>Aby móc odpowiedzieć na te pytania należy zastanowić się jak stworzyć model
oceny dokumentacji pod kątem jakości i dojrzałości, a następnie jak wykorzystać
te informacje do planowania pracy dokumentacyjnej. Kolejnym elementem, który
analizują rozmówcy jest zbieranie danych od użytkowników oraz wykorzystywanie
ich do wdrażania zmian w organizacji.</p><p>W dalszej części podcastu panowie dyskutują o własnych doświadczeniach. Które
metryki najlepiej sprawdzały się do tej pory? Które działają najlepiej osobno, a
które w połączeniu? Które elementy może sprawdzać automat, a które powinny być
weryfikowane przez człowieka?</p><p>Zachęcamy do posłuchania i dyskusji na temat Waszych doświadczeń z jakością
dokumentacji i sposobami na jej mierzenie.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tagi:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/dobre-praktyki">dobre-praktyki</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/warsztat">warsztat</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/dokumentacja">dokumentacja</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/jakosc">jakosc</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/podcast">podcast</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/snagit-2021-pierwsze-wrazenia">Snagit 2021 - pierwsze wrażenia</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2020-11-17T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">17 listopada 2020</time> · <!-- -->8 min aby przeczytać</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><span itemprop="name">Andrzej Niewiarowski</span></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Przed Wami kolejny artykuł na temat

Tym razem test najnowszej wersji.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="wstęp">Wstęp<a href="#wstęp" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Wstęp" title="Bezpośredni link do Wstęp">​</a></h3><p>Miałem szczęście uzyskać wczesny dostęp do nowego Snagita 2021 i wypróbować jego
<a href="https://www.techsmith.com/snagit-features.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nowe ulepszenia</a>. Wyglądają one
ciekawie. Zakres zmian interfejsu nie jest gigantyczny, jest to wciąż w dużej
mierze to samo użyteczne narzędzie, jakim jest Snagit 2020. Nie musisz się
martwić o to, że nie połapiesz się w nowej wersji. Powiedziałbym, że są to
zmiany z gatunku: małe kroki w dobrym kierunku. Tym razem nie ma tu
rewolucyjnych nowych narzędzi, ale otrzymaliśmy parę niezwykle pomocnych
ulepszeń. Są to detale, które mają duży wpływ na użyteczność wcześniej
wprowadzonych rozwiązań, plus parę mniejszych szlifów.</p><p>Tyle, jeśli chodzi o ulepszenia widoczne gołym okiem. Zmiany zaszły także pod
maską, osiągi zostały podkręcone.</p><p>Zgodnie z zasadą Alfreda Hitchcocka, wedle której należy zacząć od trzęsienia
ziemi, a potem napięcie powinno rosnąć, sekcje ze szczegółami zmian też są
ułożone w takiej kolejności, a ostatnia stanowi kulminację zmian.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="recent-captures-tray-i-inne-ulepszenia-interfejsu">Recent Captures Tray i inne ulepszenia interfejsu<a href="#recent-captures-tray-i-inne-ulepszenia-interfejsu" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Recent Captures Tray i inne ulepszenia interfejsu" title="Bezpośredni link do Recent Captures Tray i inne ulepszenia interfejsu">​</a></h3><p><a href="http://techwriter.pl/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/upload_025.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/upload_025-300x70-e1f427fcb9bf9dd4a9af3343deb7dca9.png" width="300" height="70" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><p>Panel z ostatnio wykonanymi screenami wygląda jeszcze lepiej i jest bardziej
praktyczny. Przeciąganie miniatur i zamienianie ich miejscami stało się
wizualnie bardziej klarowne. Dobrze widać co, dokąd przeciągasz. Po
przeciągnięciu widać mikro-animację, żeby nie było wątpliwości co do efektu
końcowego.</p><p><a href="http://techwriter.pl/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/2-1024x124-81c1de70224c5c4bb49b04684381d110.png" width="1024" height="124" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><p>Same miniatury wyglądają estetyczniej i jasno pokazują dodatkowe informacje,
takie jak rodzaj i format pliku, długość filmu czy gifu.</p><p>Po kliknięciu prawym na miniaturę doszła nowa komenda <em>Close Other Captures.</em></p><h2><a href="http://techwriter.pl/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/3.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/3-300x275-b5341ce6b518d1d688e7e409b2fd40dd.png" width="300" height="275" class="img_ev3q"></a></h2><p>Znajdziesz też małe usprawnienia w innych obszarach. W <strong>Select</strong> suwak do
przeciągania czułości „Snap to Object” nie jest stale widoczny, a tylko wtedy,
gdy opcja jest aktywna.</p><p>Dla narzędzia <strong>Pen</strong> doszła opcja „Smooth”, która wygładza ręcznie narysowaną
kreskę. Jeśli użyjesz opcji „Create as vector” możesz włączać i wyłączać
wygładzanie dla utworzonej linii.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="jeszcze-lepsza-wydajność">Jeszcze lepsza wydajność<a href="#jeszcze-lepsza-wydajność" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Jeszcze lepsza wydajność" title="Bezpośredni link do Jeszcze lepsza wydajność">​</a></h3><p>Choć nie narzekałem na prędkość mojego Snagita 2020, z którego korzystałem pod
Windows 10, to według producenta, wersja 2021 jest jeszcze szybsza. Faktycznie,
testowałem ją i śmiga. Snagit odpala się błyskawicznie. Czas reakcji na
wciśnięcie przycisku PRINT SCREEN, przejście od zrobienia screena do edycji, czy
czas sklejania zdjęcia panoramicznego są naprawdę imponujące.</p><p>Opcja „Smart Move” dla <strong>Move</strong> dostała turbodoładowanie. <strong>Simplify</strong> działa
szybciej i lepiej.</p><p>Poprawiło się też wyświetlanie linii w <strong>Edytorze</strong>.</p><p>Podsumowując, nowy Snagit działa szybciej, tworzone screeny wyglądają lepiej w
<strong>Edytorze</strong>, a oprócz tego, zapisywane animowane gify będą mieć mniejszy
rozmiar na dysku.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="magnify-20">Magnify 2.0<a href="#magnify-20" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Magnify 2.0" title="Bezpośredni link do Magnify 2.0">​</a></h3><p>Podrasowane narzędzia będę określał jako <strong>2.0</strong>, a ich wcześniejszy stan przed
Snagit 2021 oznaczał będę jako <strong>1.0</strong>.</p><p>Z narzędzia <strong>Magnify 1.0</strong> (nie mylić ze <strong>Spotlight and Magnify</strong>) korzystałem
niezbyt często, między innymi dlatego, że moje ilustracje nie wymagają
powiększania fragmentów obrazu, żeby pokazać detale. Myślę jednak, że po obecnym
uaktualnieniu, nie przepuszczę okazji, by z niego korzystać.</p><p>Po pierwsze, doszła możliwość wybrania innych kształtów niż koło. Teraz dostępny
jest zwykły prostokąt i prostokąt z zaokrąglonymi rogami.</p><p><a href="http://techwriter.pl/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-05_23-18-48.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/2020-11-05_23-18-48-300x164-730a649e641a063bd831e00183a82d5b.png" width="300" height="164" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><p>Poziom zaokrąglenia można dostosować przeciągając żółty punkt, aż do uzyskania
owalu. Z okręgu też uzyskasz owal, co wcześniej nie było możliwe.</p><p><strong>Magnify 1.0</strong> pokazywał tylko to, co było pod spodem obszaru „lupy”.
Powiększenie zawsze przykrywało obszar oryginalnej wielkości razem z dodatkowym
buforem zależnym od wielkości lupy. <strong>Spotlight and Magnify</strong> miał tę przewagę,
że można było przesunąć powiększony obraz, by uwidocznić okolicę powiększonego
fragmentu.</p><p>W <strong>Magnify 2.0</strong> wystarczy kliknąć na krzyżyk na środku lupy, by przeciągnąć
powiększenie z dala od tego, co pod spodem.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-1"><a href="http://techwriter.pl/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-05_23-50-09.png" target="_blank"

mogę stworzyć theme, który będzie bez cieni. Dzięki, TechSmith!</p><p>Doszła też funkcja podglądu: wybierając kolory i czcionki zobaczysz na bieżąco
jak wyglądają obiekty po wprowadzonej zmianie.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-3"><a href="http://techwriter.pl/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/9.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/9-300x177-1d01cb91aec4866b2a634d6c62a2c562.png" width="300" height="177" class="img_ev3q"></a><a href="#-3" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do -3" title="Bezpośredni link do -3">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="simplify-20">Simplify 2.0<a href="#simplify-20" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Simplify 2.0" title="Bezpośredni link do Simplify 2.0">​</a></h3><p>Każdy, kto robi wiele screen shotów przedstawiających interfejsy, powinien się
przyjrzeć temu narzędziu. Już wcześniej był to potężny kombajn do ułatwiania
pracy. Teraz ten kombajn działa jeszcze szybciej, sprytniej i ma dodatkowe
funkcje.</p><p><strong>Simplify 1.0</strong> tworzył uproszczone grafiki na bazie wskazanego zdjęcia. Można
było też dostosować wybrane kolory. Jednak począwszy od <strong>2.0</strong> będzie można
zapisać zestaw kolorów i użyć je przy kolejnych upraszczanych obrazach, co
pozwoli na wizualną spójność i zaoszczędzenie czasu. Co ciekawe, jeśli zmieni
się paleta barw używanych przez Twoją firmę, wystarczy, że dostosujesz daną
„Color Palette” i zmiana nastąpi w każdym otworzonym obrazie, który korzysta z
<strong>Simplify</strong> i tej palety. W ten sposób można szybko wprowadzić zmianę na
szeroką skalę. Oprócz tego, w <strong>Tool Properties</strong> doszła też opcja „Move” do
przesuwania obiektów automatycznie stworzonych przez <strong>Simplify</strong> lub tych
narysowanych ręcznie. Choć „Draw” też pozwala przesuwać, to dzięki „Move”
skupisz się na samym przesuwaniu, bez ryzyka, że przypadkiem zaczniesz rysować
kształty.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="template-20">Template 2.0<a href="#template-20" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Template 2.0" title="Bezpośredni link do Template 2.0">​</a></h3><p>Myślę, że tutaj nastąpił największy przełom. Wcześniej mniej korzystałem z
szablonów, głównie dlatego, że nie tworzę instrukcji „krok po kroku”. Szkoda, że
nie mogę się cofnąć z tym narzędziem do czasów, gdy tworzyłem takie materiały
tuzinami. W każdym razie, z ciekawości zacząłem eksperymentować z szablonami, by
zobaczyć co zmieniło się od wersji 2020 i widzę tu wiele rzeczy godnych uwagi.</p><p>Zarówno w <strong>Template 1.0</strong> i <strong>2.0</strong> są dwa sposoby na użycie szablonu.</p><p>Możesz zaznaczyć interesujące Cię obrazy i użyć komendy <em>Combine in Template</em>,
po czym wybierasz szablon, kolejność ułożenia obrazów, nadajesz tytuł i podpisy.</p><p>Ewentualnie możesz kliknąć umieszczony na górze ekranu <strong>Create =&gt; Image from
Template</strong>. Wtedy otrzymujesz pusty szablon z napisami do dodania i obrazami do
przeciągnięcia z <strong>Recent Captures Tray</strong>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-4"><a href="http://techwriter.pl/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/10.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/10-292x300-df736c0f8ce0319c87cf7cea06c3b232.png" width="292" height="300" class="img_ev3q"></a><a href="#-4" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do -4" title="Bezpośredni link do -4">​</a></h2><p>Nowością w <strong>2.0</strong> jest to, że po przejściu wszystkich kroków <em>Combine in
Template</em> możesz dostosowywać i rozwijać sekwencję obrazów bezpośrednio w
obszarze roboczym <strong>Edytora</strong>.</p><p>Nie musisz na nowo wybierać tego samego szablonu dla zmienionego zestawu
obrazów, nie ustalasz ich kolejności po raz drugi, nie wpisujesz jeszcze raz
tytułu i podpisów.</p><p>Klikając prawym przyciskiem w obszarze roboczym możesz usunąć część nagłówkową i
podpis (<em>Remove Section</em>). Tak samo łatwo wykasujesz nadmiarowe kroki.</p><p>Żeby zmienić kolejność kroków, po prostu przeciągnij odpowiadające im zdjęcia.
Zostało to wykonane bardzo intuicyjnie. Możesz dostosować odstępy między
sekcjami, przeciągając niebieską linię. Klikając na niebieski plus, z łatwością
dodasz nowy, pusty krok, nagłówek czy podpis. Dla nowego, pustego kroku
wystarczy przeciągnąć obrazek z <strong>Recent Capture Tray</strong> i przeedytować podpis.</p><p>Teraz, nawet jeśli na początku wybierzesz złą kolejność kroków, nie musisz
rozpoczynać tej procedury od nowa – możesz poprzeciągać kroki bezpośrednio na
gotowym obrazie z ich całą sekwencją. Dzięki tym możliwościom, możesz przerabiać
to, co już zostało stworzone.</p><p>Łatwiej też jest usunąć lub zmodyfikować elementy, które zawiera szablon, takie
jak linie horyzontalne, automatyczna data czy logo TechSmith. Nie podoba Ci się
fragment szablonu? Dostosuj go lub usuń.</p><p>Snagit 2021 dostarczany jest z listą darmowych szablonów z możliwością
dokupienia ich większej liczby w ramach usługi

pomysłu na jego wykorzystanie.</p><p>Ostatnio w mojej firmie użyłem szablonów po sesji z udostępnianiem ekranu.
Kolega inżynier rysował na moich oczach pomocniczą ilustrację (sesję bez
rysowania na wirtualnej tablicy uważam za straconą). Zrobiłem kilka screen
shotów na różnych etapach tworzenia i komplikowania rysunku 😊. Następnie,
zaznaczyłem potrzebne obrazy i z pomocą komendy <em>Combine in Template</em> stworzyłem
sekwencję kroków, do której dodałem opisy. Voila! Efekt cieszy oko i mogłem to
szybko wrzucić do mojej notatki po spotkaniu. Dobra rzecz.</p><p>Innym ciekawym sposobem na wykorzystanie szablonu jest zrobienie notatki o
bieżących zadaniach. Wybierasz szablon z obrazami ustawionymi w osi pionowej, z
numerowanymi krokami. Wpisujesz tam hasłowe opisy Twoich głównych zadań oraz
grafikę ilustrującą zadanie - może być to fragment maila, screen z prezentacji,
powiększenie obrazu notatki, itp. Następnie ustawiasz zadania zgodnie z ich
ważnością. Po wykonaniu zadania opisywanego w danym kroku, usuwasz sekcję.
Dochodzi nowe zadanie – dodajesz nowy krok. Zmieniły się priorytety – zamieniasz
kroki miejscami.</p><p>W dowolnym momencie możesz udostępnić taki obraz osobie, z którą pracujesz, co
daje pogląd na to, czym obecnie się zajmujesz i jakie masz priorytety.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="koniec">Koniec<a href="#koniec" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Koniec" title="Bezpośredni link do Koniec">​</a></h3><p>To już jest koniec mojego podsumowania. Wybór tego, co najważniejsze w Snagit
2021 jest oczywiście subiektywny. Wciąż uważam, że zmiany w <strong>Template 2.0</strong>
wprowadzają nową jakość i komfort pracy z narzędziem.</p><p>Każdy, zależnie od branży, specjalności i projektu korzysta ze Snagita inaczej.
Być może nie planujesz stosować szablonów.</p><p>Korzyścią, którą odczują wszyscy użytkownicy nowej wersji to zwiększona
wydajność aplikacji.</p><p>Osoby chcące rozwijać swój warsztat w dziedzinie pracy z multimediami, powinny
