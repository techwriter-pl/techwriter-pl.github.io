            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2023, the Technical Writing Team at
<a href="https://www.hitachienergy.com/pl/pl/about-us/company-profile/centrum-technologiczne" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hitachi Energy</a>
in Kraków participated in <a href="https://www.districtc.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">District C</a>, a project run
by the
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/school/uncw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of North Carolina Wilmington</a>
(UNCW) to inspire the next generation of energy professionals. This project was
a perfect storm of teamwork, where the Hitachi Energy employees gave the
students the glimpses of the day-to-day experiences of documentation developers.
The collaboration provided valuable insights into technical writing,
cross-cultural teamwork, and continuous improvement, which makes this story a
compelling read for those interested in education, design thinking, or
professional development.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introduction">Introduction<a href="https://techwriter.pl/district-c-collaboration#introduction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Introduction" title="Bezpośredni link do Introduction">​</a></h2>
<p>District C lets students explore a real-life company's business operations. They
learn about the unique aspects of an industry hands-on. In the end, students
offer practical advice to the given problem during a pitch meeting, often their
first experience presenting a business case to stakeholders. Read the story of
the collaboration between District C and Hitachi Energy in Kraków. The story is
told by Andrzej, on behalf of the Technical Writing Team.</p>

<p>In 2023, our Technical Writing Team consisted of four people, two of whom were
new joiners. Each of us had a different set of experiences and knowledge to
share. It was in our best interest to think about how to collaborate better and
align our efforts.</p>
<p>We were happy to exchange thoughts with a group of American students of English
Studies at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/school/uncw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UNCW</a> and the Polish
post-graduate students taking a technical writing course at the
<a href="https://vistula.edu.pl/kierunki-studiow/komunikacja-techniczna" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vistula</a>
non-public university. The students participating in the project could interview
the Technical Writing Team about our team's role at Hitachi Energy. They used
design thinking principles to examine our work environment, aiming to analyze,
find opportunities, gather suggestions, and present them. All of that happened
under the watchful eye of
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lance-cummings-phd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Lance Cummings</a>, an
English professor who specializes in applying AI in the realm of writing. He was
the originator of this unusual project.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="intricacies-of-technical-writing">Intricacies of technical writing<a href="https://techwriter.pl/district-c-collaboration#intricacies-of-technical-writing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Intricacies of technical writing" title="Bezpośredni link do Intricacies of technical writing">​</a></h2>
<p>We shared our experiences that gave the students an idea of what makes technical
writing rewarding and challenging:</p>
<ul>
<li>Processing high volume of information</li>
<li>Gathering insights from experts and seeking feedback</li>
<li>Building knowledge about complex products and systems developed at Hitachi
Energy</li>
</ul>

<p>First, there were two rounds of Zoom meetings where information was shared.</p>
<p>The members of the Hitachi Energy Team explained what it is like to be a
Technical Writer and why this role requires specialized expertise. Concise and
clear data gave insight into the organization's daily work and critical focus
areas.</p>
<p>Then, students reflected on what was said and came back with additional
questions to dig deeper. Each student group had a specific amount of time to ask
strategic questions. These were intense, focused sessions in which both sides
tried to use the available time as best they could.</p>
<p>This exercise had already proven beneficial to the Hitachi Energy Team. We all
knew the specifics of our daily operations well. Still, it was a useful exercise
to describe our role to someone outside of our working environment. Explaining
without relying on jargon, project names, and mental shortcuts was challenging.
It helped us to reflect on our needs and better understand them by clear
formulation.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-big-event">The big event<a href="https://techwriter.pl/district-c-collaboration#the-big-event" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do The big event" title="Bezpośredni link do The big event">​</a></h2>
<p>Student groups learned what operating in a modern global corporate workplace is
like. They gathered input, applied design thinking principles, identified
opportunities for growth, and suggested sound solutions, which were then
presented during the final <strong>pitch meeting</strong> held over Zoom.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techwriter.pl/assets/images/hitachi_crew-1448d36c5dd7420eee7598469e10bac0.png" width="1024" height="554" class="img_ev3q"><strong>Proud contributors of the District C initiative.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pitch meeting</strong> is a presentation where an individual or a team presents a
business idea or concept to potential investors, stakeholders, or clients to
secure funding, support, or interest in the project. The presentation usually
includes an overview of the product or service and the proposed solution.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="recommendations">Recommendations<a href="https://techwriter.pl/district-c-collaboration#recommendations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Recommendations" title="Bezpośredni link do Recommendations">​</a></h2>
<p>Each group presented its assessment of the opportunities and provided practical
recommendations. Fresh perspectives and solutions were appreciated, as they
logically tied to the identified areas for improvement. At the same time, the
Hitachi Energy Team offered practical feedback that was rooted in business
operations, experience, and practice.</p>
<p>Students focused mainly on the nature of the interactions between the Technical
Writers and the Subject Matter Experts (SMEs).</p>
<p>They then explored questions such as: "What is the most efficient way to get
insights from an SME and build product knowledge?" and "Are multiple team
members often asked the same questions?".</p>
<p>One suggestion was to invite all SMEs to a single session to get all their
answers. Alternatively, this could be resolved asynchronously through Teams or a
survey.</p>
<p>Other recommendations included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conducting dedicated workshops to get product insights</li>
<li>Incorporating short videos to distribute knowledge and information</li>
<li>Using Scrum Master's advice to optimize the collaboration between the Tech
Writers and the Dev team</li>
<li>Establishing a more formalized review process</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-takeaways">The takeaways<a href="https://techwriter.pl/district-c-collaboration#the-takeaways" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do The takeaways" title="Bezpośredni link do The takeaways">​</a></h2>
<p>Though we have not used every recommendation, we gained a clearer picture of our
needs and possibilities. The challenge allowed for the analysis of how we
operate on a daily basis. It emphasized the strategic and business objectives
that are key to the effectiveness of the processes we run in Kraków and the
global organization.</p>
<p>As part of continuous improvement, we regularly reevaluate our approach to
documentation process and collaboration. Even a year later, we still actively
use the good ideas we picked up during the District C project.</p>
<p>For example, District C inspired us to try Microsoft Loop to engage multiple
Subject Matter Experts quickly.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techwriter.pl/assets/images/group_photo-d3f6d49fe0937ca11f374bc7faa1c1ee.jpg" width="2043" height="1219" class="img_ev3q"> <strong>Happy participants at the Hitachi Energy Office in

<p>It is worth emphasizing the international nature of this project. To gain
insights into this aspect, shortly after the project was completed, we met the
US participants in the Kraków office and asked about their experiences.</p>
<p>The American view by
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/quinn-williams-/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quinn Williams</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This program was especially helpful in understanding how different people with
different backgrounds can approach business issues. We got to work with Polish
students, and sharing ideas required us to keep our communication skills at
the forefront. If we had not practiced effective communication, we would not
have successfully conveyed some implied thoughts from our American point of
view. This foundation helped us understand the importance of creating a strong
team bond and interpersonal practices.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I also enjoyed experiencing the program's professional side, where we
communicated with the Hitachi Energy team members. It was interesting to see
where the Polish work culture differed from the American culture and where
there was an overlap. I think our teams were able to use essential pieces from
both sides to create an effective workflow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We also received insights from the Polish perspective, provided by
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/monika-dabrowska1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monika Dąbrowska</a>, a
participant in the technical writing postgraduate studies at
<a href="https://vistula.edu.pl/kierunki-studiow/komunikacja-techniczna" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vistula</a>
non-public university:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I particularly liked about District C was that we could exchange our
experiences regarding learning and creating projects. The Polish education
system and culture lead to a general mindset somewhat contrasting that of
American students.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, the American view of the Poles is far from what we showed during the
project. Similarly, the Poles also have certain misconceptions about the
Americans. These assumptions and presuppositions were discussed and challenged
during our cooperation, and we found power in our variety, creativity,
exchanging experiences, and understanding one another.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Technical Writing Team was happy to meet and get to know the US participants
during their visit to the Kraków office and at the soap! content conference,
where we also met some of the Polish students. After the intense cooperation,
bonding during that event was fun.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://techwriter.pl/district-c-collaboration#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Conclusion" title="Bezpośredni link do Conclusion">​</a></h2>
<p>The collaboration between Hitachi Energy and District C was a truly enlightening
experience. Students gained a deeper understanding of the technical writing
profession and the complexities of the energy sector. They provided valuable
recommendations to improve collaboration between Technical Writers and SMEs,
such as conducting dedicated workshops and using short videos for knowledge
distribution.</p>
<p>The project also highlighted the benefits of cross-cultural collaboration, with
American and Polish participants gaining insights into different work cultures
and communication styles.</p>
<p>The Hitachi Energy Team benefited from the fresh perspectives and practical
solutions provided by the students, emphasizing the importance of continuous
improvement. The ongoing impact of the collaboration is evident in the continued
use of some recommendations, such as using Microsoft Loop to engage multiple
SMEs quickly.</p>
<p>We are grateful to the students willing to listen to our stories and support us,
the practitioners of the obscure art of tech writing. One can always count on
the students to come up with fresh ideas! They were bright, open-minded, and not
burdened with presumptions. We wish you all the best!</p>
<p>And thank you, Dr. Cummings, for creating such a fruitful initiative — we really
enjoyed being a part of it.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[30 października wrocławska społeczność rzemieślników i artystów tworzenia treści technicznych spotkała się w Infor Academy, korzystając z uprzejmości firmy Infor, już po raz trzeci! 🙏]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>30 października wrocławska społeczność rzemieślników i artystów tworzenia treści technicznych spotkała się w Infor Academy, korzystając z uprzejmości firmy Infor, już po raz trzeci! 🙏</p>
<p>W historii meetupów naszej społeczności tematyka jest dość różnorodna. Mamy tematy ściśle pisarskie, czasem prelegenci opowiadają też o ciekawym przypadku użycia lub chcą zainspirować do zmiany innych po tym jak wdrożyli pewnie rozwiązania u siebie.</p>
<p>Tym razem jednak temat był niezwykle praktyczny i śmiało można powiedzieć, że dotyczył każdego, kto nie tylko zajmuje się pisaniem (lub ogólniej: tworzeniem) ale też każdego, kto ma coś do zrobienia - czyli zasadniczo naprawdę KAŻDEGO 😀</p>
<p>Nasza prelegentka <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anna-j%C3%B3zala-5008a453/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ania Józala</a> z wielkim wdziękiem zaprezentowała słuchaczom przegląd najbardziej efektywnych form organizacji i pracy.</p>
<p>Ania wyszła od tezy, iż pomimo, że podstawowym biznesem każdego pisarza (technicznego również) jest pisanie, to mamy jednocześnie ogrom zadań nie związanych z pisaniem. Przykłady? Tworzenie i aktualizowanie zadań w Jirze, spotkania z zespołem, powiadomienia ze Slacka czy Teamsów, które domagają się naszej uwagi już teraz - można je mnożyć!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="odzyskaj-kontrolę-nad-wydarzeniami">Odzyskaj kontrolę nad wydarzeniami<a href="https://techwriter.pl/meet-content-wro-pazdziernik-2024-relacja#odzyskaj-kontrol%C4%99-nad-wydarzeniami" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Odzyskaj kontrolę nad wydarzeniami" title="Bezpośredni link do Odzyskaj kontrolę nad wydarzeniami">​</a></h2>
<p>Ale jak? Ania podała kilka praktycznych sposobów: zacznij od zrzucenia wszystkich zadań w jedno miejsce, może to być kartka papieru lub excel. Ale musisz wyrzucić z głowy naprawdę wszystko, tak, żeby te zadania przestały Cię dręczyć i można było je rozpracować.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="kategoryzuj">Kategoryzuj<a href="https://techwriter.pl/meet-content-wro-pazdziernik-2024-relacja#kategoryzuj" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Kategoryzuj" title="Bezpośredni link do Kategoryzuj">​</a></h2>
<p>Kolejny krok to przejrzenie i skategoryzowanie zadań. Tu prelegentka wspomniała o 5 pytaniach, które mogą okazać się pomocne przy kategoryzacji:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tematyka lub przynależność danego zadania do konkretnego projektu.</li>
<li>Termin - czy jest jakiś czas, w którym dane zadanie musi być wykonane?</li>
<li><em>2 minute rule</em> - czy mogę zrobić to zadanie w czasi dwóch minut? Zadania typu: przeskanowanie i otagowanie mail w skrzynce, zaakceptowanie wniosków urlopowych, i temu podobne.</li>
<li>Czy mogę to zadanie przekazać komuś innemu? - posiadanie takiej kategorii przydaje się szczególnie gdy przy wielkim nawale pracy przychodzi współpracownik i pyta czy może Ci jakoś pomóc.</li>
<li>Czy to jest priorytet?</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="priorytety-priorytety">Priorytety, priorytety...<a href="https://techwriter.pl/meet-content-wro-pazdziernik-2024-relacja#priorytety-priorytety" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Priorytety, priorytety..." title="Bezpośredni link do Priorytety, priorytety...">​</a></h3>
<p>Ania przypomniała nam o macierzy Eisenhowera, która posługuje się osią <em>ważne - pilne</em>. Przy szczególnym nacisku na ćwiartkę: <em>nieważne - pilne</em> jako wyjątkowo wdzięczny rezerwuar zadań nadających się do oddelegowania.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="kalendarz">Kalendarz<a href="https://techwriter.pl/meet-content-wro-pazdziernik-2024-relacja#kalendarz" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Kalendarz" title="Bezpośredni link do Kalendarz">​</a></h2>
<p>Okazuje się, że stare dobre narzędzie jakim jest kalendarz może nas bardzo wesprzeć w planowaniu i organizacji pracy. Ania wspomniała o metodach: <em>time boxingu</em> i <em>pracy w blokach</em> jako tych, które sprawnie minimalizują efekty przełączania kontekstów, tym samym zwiększając nasze skupienie i produktywność.</p>
<p><em>Time boxing</em> polega na blokowaniu przedziałów czasowych na pracę głęboką, przykładowo od 8:00 do 12:00. Natomiast praca w blokach to ustalanie bloków czasowych, które chcemy poświęcić na konkretne zadania, czyli na przykład:</p>
<ul>
<li>8:00-10:00 - przygotowywanie prezentacji</li>
<li>10:00-12:00 - zbieranie materiałów do wykonania zadania XYZ</li>
</ul>
<p>Oczywiście nawet najbardziej zadbany i rozplanowany kalendarz nie gwarantuje sukcesu póki my sami nie zechcemy się go ściśle trzymać 😉</p>
<p>Tu z pomocą może przyjść kolejna opcja: praca w trybie samolotowym.
A żeby mieć już całkiem czyste sumienie, można też ustawić sobie opis na Slacku informujący współpracowników że nadal pracujesz tyle, że w stanie skupienia 😀</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ale-jak-zacząć">Ale jak zacząć?<a href="https://techwriter.pl/meet-content-wro-pazdziernik-2024-relacja#ale-jak-zacz%C4%85%C4%87" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Ale jak zacząć?" title="Bezpośredni link do Ale jak zacząć?">​</a></h2>
<p>Ania przypomniała o starej i dobrej technice <em>pomodoro</em>. Ustaw pracę na 25 minut i przez ten czas faktycznie zajmij się pracą, bez rozproszeń. Potem niech zadzwoni twój nowy minutnik kuchenny w kształcie pomidora 🍅 (albo kurczaka, albo czego tam chcesz). Potem robisz 5 minut przerwy, w trakcie której faktycznie wstaniesz od biurka i pójdziesz zrobić sobie coś do picia albo chwilkę się rozciągasz. Potem kolejne 25 minut i tak na zmianę. Po jakimś czasie podobno wpada się we flow i już nie potrzeba minutnika bo pędzisz jak szalony! 💨</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="słoń-i-żaba">Słoń i żaba<a href="https://techwriter.pl/meet-content-wro-pazdziernik-2024-relacja#s%C5%82o%C5%84-i-%C5%BCaba" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Słoń i żaba" title="Bezpośredni link do Słoń i żaba">​</a></h3>
<p>Są czasem takie zadania, które nas zwyczajnie przytłaczają. Są ogromne i nie bardzo wiadomo jak je ugryźć.</p>
<p>Tu podobno sprawdza się jedzenie tego słonia po kawałku, czyli rozdzielenie mega zadania, na mniejsze, które mogą stanowić pewne oddzielne i niezależne działania, które można nawet wyestymować czasowo. Prawda, że już raźniej? 😀</p>
<p>A żaba? No cóż, jeśli na liście zadań na dziś jest jakieś, które wyjątkowo ci nie leży, czyli ta przysłowiowa żaba - zjedz ją na początku dnia, wtedy, jak mówi klasyk, Mark Twain, już nic gorszego cię nie spotka. Czyli zasadniczo - już będzie z górki.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-co-jeśli-nie-i-koniec">A co jeśli ‘Nie i koniec!’<a href="https://techwriter.pl/meet-content-wro-pazdziernik-2024-relacja#a-co-je%C5%9Bli-nie-i-koniec" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do A co jeśli ‘Nie i koniec!’" title="Bezpośredni link do A co jeśli ‘Nie i koniec!’">​</a></h2>
<p>A co jeśli napotkamy blokadę twórczą?</p>
<p>Ania wspomniała o zjawisku tak zwanej <em>fiksacji kognitywnej</em>, czyli sytuacji, w której masz wrażenie, że nic już nie wymyślisz i nie robisz postępów w pracy. Wtedy podobno pomaga zmiana kontekstu, czyli można przełączyć się na inne zadanie kreatywne, pójść na spacer (ale nie brać zafiksowanego problemu ze sobą) lub… iść pod prysznic!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="jesteś-zwycięzcą">Jesteś zwycięzcą!<a href="https://techwriter.pl/meet-content-wro-pazdziernik-2024-relacja#jeste%C5%9B-zwyci%C4%99zc%C4%85" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Jesteś zwycięzcą!" title="Bezpośredni link do Jesteś zwycięzcą!">​</a></h2>
<p>Po całym dniu efektywnej pracy, nie może zabraknąć również przestrzeni na nagradzanie się za postępy i wytrwałość.</p>
<p>To jest chyba naszym wyjątkowo słabym punktem i można prześmiewczo podejść do sprawy, ale małe, lecz systematyczne postępy potrafią zaprowadzić nas bardzo daleko! 🛣️</p>
<hr>
<p>Jestem absolutnie pewna, że najbliższy poniedziałek po meetupie z Anią w roli głównej wszyscy obecni spędzili na spisywaniu i kategoryzowaniu zadań oraz przemeblowaniu kalendarza!</p>
<p>Wstąpiły w nas nowe organizacyjne siły! 💪</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Choć na zewnątrz robi się już coraz ciemniej (i straszniej <!-- -->👻<!-- -->), ekipa
Content Bytes nie boi się nowych wyzwań, zwłaszcza gdy u boku mamy <strong>girls.js</strong>!
Współpraca ta pozwala nam jeszcze w tym miesiącu powrócić z
kolejnym wydarzeniem, tym razem poświęconym tematyce <strong>dostępności treści</strong>.</p>
<p>Podczas spotkania <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/olgastefaniuk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Olga Stefaniuk</a>,
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justi-sztyper-134520a5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Justi Sztyper</a> oraz
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zuzanna-szott/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zuzanna Szott</a> opowiedzą między
innymi o tym, czy tworzone treści mogą być dostępne dla wszystkich, jak
neuroróżnorodni użytkownicy pracują z contentem i aplikacjami oraz jak
dostępność wpływa zarówno na twórców treści i tych, którzy z nich korzystają.</p>
<p>Po prezentacjach zapraszamy na mały poczęstunek oraz wymianę doświadczeń i
opinii <!-- -->🍕<!-- -->.</p>
<p>Pamiętajcie o rejestracji, to pozwoli nam na wybór odpowiedniej sali i
zaplanowanie poczęstunku. Link do formularza znajdziecie

<p><strong><em>Moje prawo to twoje lewo. Czy istnieją treści użyteczne dla wszystkich?</em></strong></p>
<p>Słowa kształtują rzeczywistość – tę cyfrową również. Z ich pomocą możemy
wspierać lub wykluczać całe grupy użytkowników naszych produktów, dlatego warto
robić to świadomie. Podczas prelekcji porozmawiamy o tym, jak identyfikować
językowe potrzeby i problemy użytkowników oraz jakich narzędzi używać, żeby
odpowiednio na nie reagować.</p>
<p><strong><em>Dostępność kognitywna i neuroróżnorodność w pracy z treścią i aplikacjami
webowymi</em></strong></p>
<p>W swojej prezentacji Olga i Justi poruszą zagadnienia neuroróżnorodności oraz
dostępności kognitywnej. Dowiecie się, jak neuroróżnorodni użytkownicy pracują z
tresciami i aplikacjami webowymi, co może być dla nich problematyczne i jak temu
zaradzić. Dodatkowo, poznacie najlepsze praktyki stosowane w tworzeniu
dostępnych aplikacji i treści oraz zalecenia Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines (WCAG) w kontekście dostępności.</p>

<p><a href="https://girlsjs.pl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">girls.js</a> to inicjatywa, której celem jest przyciągnięcie
kobiet do IT. Poprzez zachęcenie do kodowania, organizatorzy chcą zaszczepić w
kobietach pasję do nowych technologii i pokazać, że świat IT stoi przed nimi
otworem. Założenia inicjatywy realizowane są poprzez spotkania i warsztaty dla
kobiet.</p>

<p>Celem <strong>Content Bytes</strong> jest stworzenie przestrzeni, w której twórcy contentu
mogą wymieniać się doświadczeniami i omawiać tematy związane z tworzeniem
treści. Według nas, content to nie tylko sam proces pisania, ale tak
naprawdę&nbsp;cały ekosystem uwzględniający UX, UI, design, a także zagadnienia
dostępności, zarządzania i związanej z nimi technologii.</p>

<p>Organizatorom zależy, by spotkania były istotne i przybliżały tematy, które są
dla Was interesujące. Możecie zgłosić temat, a my dołożymy wszelkich starań, aby
znaleźć prelegentów, którzy będą mogli o nim porozmawiać. Możecie także sami
zostać prelegentami na jednym z naszych spotkań.</p>

<p>P: Czy wydarzenie będzie nagrywane lub transmitowane na żywo? <br> O: Na

poznać inne osoby zainteresowane contentem.</p>
<p>P: Czy można udostępnić prezentacje prelegentów? <br> O: To zależy od
prelegenta. Podczas wydarzenia można jednak zadawać pytania i robić zdjęcia,

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lubicie meetupy? My je wręcz uwielbiamy. Dlatego z nieukrywaną radością witamy nowego gracza na rynku spotkań dla contentowców - <strong>Content Bytes</strong>.<br>
<!-- -->Inicjatywa jest świeżutka jak ciepłe bułeczki od lokalnego piekarza, ale znając zapał i pracowitość organizatorów nie mamy wątpliwości, że będzie się działo. Ale zacznijmy od początku.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="nowa-marka-znane-twarze">Nowa marka, znane twarze<a href="https://techwriter.pl/content-bytes-promo#nowa-marka-znane-twarze" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Nowa marka, znane twarze" title="Bezpośredni link do Nowa marka, znane twarze">​</a></h2>
<p>Pomimo tego, że jest to nowa inicjatywa, stoją za nią osoby, które już dały się nam poznać jakiś czas temu za sprawą organizacji krakowskich meetupów MeetContentKRK. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/barbara-szwarc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Basia Czyż</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/edyta-rakowska" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edyta Rakowska</a> i <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michal-olender" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michał Olender</a>, bo to o nich mowa, mają na swoim koncie całkiem sporo udanych spotkań, które zorganizowali przy współpracy z różnymi firmami i instytucjami, np. Wydziałem Anglistyki Uniwersytetu Jagiellońskiego. Największym przedsięwzięciem z jakim się zmierzyli był <a href="https://techwriter.pl/meet-content-krk-content-day-podsumowanie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Content Day</a> - całodniowy meetup, który był połączeniem warsztatów i wykładów. Jak widać, ekipa Content Bytes jest mocno zaprawiona w bojach i jesteśmy pewni, że jeszcze nieraz nas zaskoczy. Tym bardziej, że w ostatnim czasie zespół zyskał dodatkowego zawodnika w osobie <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pawelchlodnicki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pawła Chłodnickiego</a>. Co tu dużo pisać - z taką grupą zapaleńców można konie kraść.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="mocny-start">Mocny start<a href="https://techwriter.pl/content-bytes-promo#mocny-start" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Mocny start" title="Bezpośredni link do Mocny start">​</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://techwriter.pl/content-bytes-pazdziernik-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pierwsze spotkanie</a> pod szyldem Content Bytes miało miejsce 3 października 2024 w Krakowie. Kolejne planowane jest na 30 października 2024. Długofalowe plany zakładają jeden meetup na miesiąc.<br>
<!-- -->Póki co, inicjatywa działa na terenie Krakowa, ale niewykluczone, że w przyszłości rozszerzy swój zakres działania na kolejne miasta.<br>
<!-- -->Plany są ambitne, ale wierzymy, że znajdą się zarówno prelegenci jak i partnerzy, dzięki którym uda się je zrealizować.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="skąd-pomysł">Skąd pomysł<a href="https://techwriter.pl/content-bytes-promo#sk%C4%85d-pomys%C5%82" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Skąd pomysł" title="Bezpośredni link do Skąd pomysł">​</a></h2>
<p>Główną ideą było stworzenie meetupów, w czasie których szeroko pojęci specjaliści zajmujący się treścią mogliby wymieniać się swoją wiedzą i doświadczeniem. Ale to nie wszystko. Organizatorom najbardziej zależy na tym, żeby dyskusja o contencie wyszła poza granice naszego techcommowego światka i objęła swoim zasięgiem inne dziedziny związane z rozwojem produktu, takie jak UX design, UX writing czy dostępność&nbsp;rozwiązań.</p>
<p>Cytując klasyka, “to wysoko postawiona poprzeczka”. Na szczęście organizatorzy mają plan jak osiągnąć swoje cele, który zakłada zapraszanie do wystąpień osoby z różnych obszarów skupionych na produkcie i połączenie sił z innymi inicjatywami. I nie jest to tylko czcza gadanina. Drugi meetup, 30 października 2024, będzie zorganizowany przy współpracy z <a href="https://girlsjs.pl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">girls.js</a>, podczas którego uczestnicy będą mieli okazję posłuchać m.in. o dostępności kognitywnej.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="każdy-może-pomóc">Każdy może pomóc<a href="https://techwriter.pl/content-bytes-promo#ka%C5%BCdy-mo%C5%BCe-pom%C3%B3c" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Każdy może pomóc" title="Bezpośredni link do Każdy może pomóc">​</a></h2>
<p>Content Bytes to inicjatywa non-profit napędzana zapałem organizatorów i wsparciem partnerów. Dzięki temu podczas spotkań możecie cieszyć się jakościowymi prezentacjami i smacznymi przekąskami.<br>
<!-- -->Rąk do pracy nigdy za wiele, więc jeśli chcielibyście wesprzeć tę inicjatywę to serdecznie do tego zachęcamy. Możecie zostać prelegentem, udostępnić miejsce na spotkanie czy sypnąć trochę grosza na drobny catering, który sprawi, że networking po prezentacjach nie będzie zagłuszany odgłosami burczących brzuchów. Możecie też przekonać swojego szefa do wsparcia Content Bytes. To tylko kilka propozycji pomocy i na pewno jest jeszcze wiele innych możliwości, o których organizatorzy chętnie Wam opowiedzą.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Upalne lato już za nami, ale ekipa <strong>Content Bytes</strong> nie próżnuje, dbając o skuteczne podgrzanie atmosfery tej jesieni.
Już za tydzień mamy dla was nie jeden, a dwa tematy :)
Podczas spotkania porozmawiamy o dokumentacji API oraz przyszłości twórców contentu w świecie dynamicznie zmieniających się produktów.
Ugości nas <strong>Forte Spaces</strong>, a dyskusje uprzyjemnią nam przekąski <!-- -->🍕<!-- --> od <strong>Apify</strong>.</p>
<p>Tematy przybliżą wam
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/barbara-szwarc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Barbara Czyż</strong></a> oraz
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pawelchlodnicki/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Paweł Chłodnicki</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Pamiętajcie o rejestracji, to pozwoli nam na wybór odpowiedniej sali i
zaplanowanie poczęstunku. Link do formularza znajdziecie

<p><strong><em>Dokumentacja API: Z czym to się je?</em></strong></p>
<p>Dokumentacja API to temat, wokół którego krąży obecnie wiele pytań:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kto powinien dokumentować API?</li>
<li>Jak zaplanować content, żeby dokumentacja była pomocna i sensownie
ustrukturyzowana?</li>
<li>Jakimi standardami powinni się kierować technical writerzy?</li>
</ul>
<p>Opierając się na przykładach, omówimy proces, w którym pomysł na nowe API staje
się udokumentowaną specyfikacją. Podczas prezentacji zapoznacie się z
narzędziami, praktykami oraz technikami współpracy, które pomagają nam tworzyć
dokumentację do API.</p>
<p><strong><em>Rola i przyszłość twórców contentu w tworzeniu produktu</em></strong></p>
<p>Pojęcie <strong>content</strong> przywołuje różne skojarzenia, często zależne od kontekstu, w
którym zostało użyte. W swojej prezentacji, Paweł opowie nam jak content jest
postrzegany przez pryzmat firmy, zespołu, momentu w rozwoju produktu, a także
wcześniej wspomnianego <strong>kontekstu</strong>. Wspólnie zastanowimy się, jak te
okoliczności mogą mieć pozytywny wpływ zarówno na twórców, jak i odbiorców
tworzonych treści.</p>

<p>Podczas pierwszego spotkania Content Bytes prezentacje poprowadzą:</p>

<p><strong>Barbara Czyż</strong>: Barbara jest dociekliwą technical writerką, pasjonującą się
podejściem docs-as-code i światem API. Po przygodach z DITA i Markdown
dołączyła do Boxa, by tworzyć dokumentację programistyczną i zacieśniać
relacje z API i kodem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Paweł Chłodnicki</strong>: Paweł swoją karierę rozpoczął na stanowisku technical
writera, a obecnie pracuje jako Content Designer w Docplanner, Doświadczenie

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jeśli chcecie udoskonalić działanie Waszej aplikacji, wprowadzić nową funkcję
lub ulepszyć istniejącą, tooltipy mogą Wam w tym pomóc. Tooltipy mogą odegrać
kluczową rolę w poprawie użyteczności aplikacji, zmniejszając dezorientację
użytkowników i ułatwiając efektywne wykonywanie zadań. W tym artykule
wyjaśniamy, czym są tooltipy i jak z nich korzystać.</p>
<p>Dowiecie się też w jaki sposób tooltipy mogą pomóc użytkownikom uniknąć
rozczarowania i pozwolić im kontynuować naukę i korzystanie z funkcji. Na
początek, małe wprowadzenie.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="czym-dokładnie-są-tooltipy">Czym dokładnie są tooltipy?<a href="https://techwriter.pl/tooltip-w-teorii-i-praktyce#czym-dok%C5%82adnie-s%C4%85-tooltipy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Czym dokładnie są tooltipy?" title="Bezpośredni link do Czym dokładnie są tooltipy?">​</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooltip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tooltipy</a> (podpowiedzi), to krótkie
komunikaty wyświetlane przez użytkownika, które dostarczają dodatkowych
informacji o wybranym elemencie strony i zachęcają użytkowników do podjęcia
działań. Tooltipy są zwykle wyświetlane poprzez naprowadzenie kursora myszy lub
poprzez odpowiednie użycie klawiatury.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="dlaczego-warto-ich-używać">Dlaczego warto ich używać?<a href="https://techwriter.pl/tooltip-w-teorii-i-praktyce#dlaczego-warto-ich-u%C5%BCywa%C4%87" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Dlaczego warto ich używać?" title="Bezpośredni link do Dlaczego warto ich używać?">​</a></h2>
<p>Istnieje wiele powodów, dla których warto używać toolipów w aplikacji, oto
niektóre z nich:</p>
<ul>
<li>zajmują niewielką ilość miejsca na ekranie, więc nie są uciążliwą formą
przesyłania wiadomości w aplikacji.</li>
<li>poprawiają użyteczność i ułatwiają wykonywanie określonych zadań.</li>
<li>zapewniają użytkownikom informacje na żądanie w momencie, gdy są potrzebne,
dzięki czemu użytkownicy mogą podejmować decyzje, skuteczniej poruszać się po
interfejsach i rozumieć funkcjonalność elementów interaktywnych.</li>
<li>wyświetlają się tylko kontekstowo, dostarczając dodatkowych wyjaśnień i
wskazówek. Swoją drogą, jeśli byłyby wyświetlane na stałe, zaśmiecałyby
interfejs użytkownika 😉.</li>
<li>mogą być nieocenionym wsparciem dla nowych użytkowników, ułatwiając im
zrozumienie funkcji, poszczególnych elementów interfejsu oraz umożliwiają
użytkownikom interakcję z treściami internetowymi. A jak? Na przykład poprzez
przypomnienie, co robi dana ikona lub gdy jakaś funkcja jest trudna do
wyjaśnienia są pomocne w nawigowaniu.</li>
<li>można je stosować zarówno do prezentacji produktów, wdrażania funkcji, czy też
szkolenia użytkowników.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="gdzie-warto-je-stosować">Gdzie warto je stosować?<a href="https://techwriter.pl/tooltip-w-teorii-i-praktyce#gdzie-warto-je-stosowa%C4%87" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Gdzie warto je stosować?" title="Bezpośredni link do Gdzie warto je stosować?">​</a></h2>
<p>Tooltipy można wszechstronne wykorzystywać w różnych biznesach, ale skupmy się
skupmy się na kilku typowych zastosowaniach w branży technologicznej. Można do
nich zaliczyć zaliczyć między innymi:</p>
<ul>
<li>wycieczki wdrożeniowe – gdy użytkownik po raz pierwszy loguje się do
aplikacji, może odbyć wycieczkę po aplikacji. Wyświetlane w aplikacji
podpowiedzi pokazują każdy aspekt danej funkcji i dostarczają informacji o
tym, co robi dana ikona.</li>
<li>interaktywne przewodniki, czyli podpowiedzi pojawiają się dopiero po
interakcji użytkownika z poprzednią podpowiedzią, dzięki czemu są bardziej
angażujące niż ogólna wycieczka po aplikacji.</li>
<li>wprowadzanie nowych funkcji – z których użytkownicy jeszcze nie korzystali -
za pomocą podpowiedzi możesz wyróżnić funkcje, które nie były jeszcze używane
i nauczyć użytkowników, jak z nich korzystać</li>
<li>zapowiadanie nowych funkcji i zmian w produktach – podpowiedzi doskonale
nadają się do ogłaszania zmian w aplikacji czy dodawania nowych funkcji.</li>
<li>zapewnienie pomocy, gdy użytkownik utknie w martwym punkcie – jeśli użytkownik
nie może ruszyć dalej, tooltipy mogą pomoc w wykonaniu konkretnych czynności
lub skierować użytkownika do źródeł „samopomocy”. Jeśli użytkownicy potrzebują
więcej informacji, wówczas mogą skorzystać z podpowiedzi zamiast kontaktować
się z pomocą techniczną.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="co-jest-ważne-podczas-tworzenia-tooltipów">Co jest ważne podczas tworzenia tooltipów?<a href="https://techwriter.pl/tooltip-w-teorii-i-praktyce#co-jest-wa%C5%BCne-podczas-tworzenia-tooltip%C3%B3w" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Co jest ważne podczas tworzenia tooltipów?" title="Bezpośredni link do Co jest ważne podczas tworzenia tooltipów?">​</a></h2>
<p>Chociaż tooltipy nie są nowością w sieci, często są one niewłaściwie stosowane
lub zaimplementowane. Na co zatem warto zwrócić uwagę przy ich tworzeniu?</p>
<ul>
<li>dodawajcie krótki tekst – tooltipy z oczywistym lub zbędnym tekstem nie
przynoszą korzyści użytkownikom. Jeśli nie możecie wymyślić pomocnej treści,
nie oferujcie podpowiedzi. Dodana podpowiedź powinna być zwięźle opisana i nie
blokować powiązanych treści… w przeciwnym razie zmarnujecie czas użytkownika,
który będzie miał pecha aktywować tę podpowiedź ☹.</li>
<li>używajcie podpowiedzi ze strzałkami – gdy elementy znajdują się blisko siebie
strzałki pomagają uniknąć nieporozumień.</li>
<li>używajcie tooltipów konsekwentnie w całej aplikacji. Niektóre elementy
aplikacji są trudne do znalezienia, ponieważ brakuje im wizualnych wskazówek.
Jeśli podpowiedzi są wyświetlane nieregularnie w całej aplikacji, użytkownicy
mogą nigdy ich nie odkryć. Ważne jest, aby być konsekwentnym i zapewniać
podpowiedzi dla wszystkich elementów projektu, a nie tylko wybranych. Jeśli
tylko niektóre elementy wymagają dodatkowych wyjaśnień, użyj wyskakujących
podpowiedzi dla tych elementów.</li>
<li>używajcie podpowiedzi dla niejednoznacznych ikon – ikony mają pewien poziom
niejednoznaczności, warto więc przemyśleć czy użyć tooltipy dla wszystkich
ikon lub zapewnić użytkownikowi wersje opisową przycisku.</li>
<li>zadbajcie o to, aby tooltipy miały tło, które nie jest zbyt jasne, ciemne ani
krzykliwe 😉 i czcionkę, która nie jest zbyt dekoracyjna ani trudna do
odczytania, aby użytkownicy mogli zobaczyć tekst w podpowiedziach. Ponadto
użytkownicy z dysfunkcjami wzroku mogą mieć trudności z odczytaniem
podpowiedzi, jeśli tekst i tło mają zbliżone kolory lub tekst jest wyjątkowo
mały i nieczytelny.</li>
<li>umieszczajcie tooltipy w taki sposób, aby nie blokowały powiązanej treści nie
były zbyt rozciągnięte – warto upewnić się czy treść nie zasłania innych
istotnych informacji związanych z celem użytkownika i nie jest zbyt
rozciągnięta.</li>
<li>pokazujcie tylko kontekstowe podpowiedzi, których użytkownicy będą używać
podczas korzystania z danego elementu - uruchamianie tooltipów które będą
potrzebne dopiero później, powoduje tylko niepotrzebny bałagan w Waszej
aplikacji.</li>
<li>zezwalajcie użytkownikom na zamykanie podpowiedzi w dowolnym momencie - można
użyć znaku (x) lub kliknięcia w wolnym polu aplikacji, który zamknie
podpowiedź. W każdym razie dobrze, żeby użytkownik widział co ma zrobić. 😉</li>
</ul>
<p>No i na koniec do znudzenia powtarzana złota zasada.</p>
<ul>
<li>ważne, żeby tooltipy były zwięzłe, spójne z resztą projektu i zbudowane z
myślą o dostępności, zgodne z wewnętrznymi lub zewnętrznymi standardami oraz
przewodnikami stylu - często zdarza się, że całe zespoły pracują nad rozwojem
różnych elementów aplikacji, dlatego ważne jest, aby wszystkie osoby kierowały
się tymi samymi zaleceniami, aby uniknąć rozbieżności, na przykład w
terminologii czy stylu tworzenia. W przypadku osób niedowidzących, należy
zadbać o ich zgodność z zasadami dostępności cyfrowej
<a href="https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Content_Accessibility_Guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WCAG</a>.
Warto wziąć pod uwagę kontrast kolorów, możliwość powiększenia tekstu czy czas
wyświetlania tooltipów. 😉</li>
</ul>

<p>Opisaliśmy już czym są podpowiedzi oraz jak i gdzie ich używać. To już połowa
sukcesu, jednak najważniejsze i najtrudniejsze do rozwiązania są kwestie drobne
i pozornie błahe, dlatego dodajemy kilka praktycznych wskazówek:</p>
<ul>
<li>weźcie pod uwagę pochodzenie użytkowników – zaplanujcie strategię, jak często
będą używać podpowiedzi i w jakim celu. Jeśli Wasi użytkownicy znają już waszą
aplikacje, może nie być konieczne dalsze wyjaśnianie każdej funkcji lub
działania. Jeśli użytkownicy są początkujący lub zróżnicowani, możecie dodać
więcej podpowiedzi.</li>
<li>wczujcie się w rolę użytkowników – możemy śmiało napisać, że jako Tech
Writerzy jesteście najbliżej sposobu myślenia użytkowników, ponieważ
postrzegacie produkty jako historie, a nie elementy.</li>
<li>zapomnijcie o tym co wiecie, o parametrach technicznych, możliwościach
programistycznych – przejdźcie przez Wasz aplikacje i zastanówcie się, gdzie
się zatrzymaliście lub utknęliście? Lub co jest jeszcze niejasne?</li>
<li>zorganizujcie sesję użyteczności – warto zdobyć informacje jak użytkownicy
korzystają z Waszego produktu. Gdzie napotykają na trudności lub w których
momentach zatrzymują się, próbując coś zrozumieć. To będzie pewnie to miejsce,
w którym warto dodać wskazówkę 😉.</li>
<li>skupcie się na funkcjonalności i korzyściach płynących z danej funkcji – jeśli
próbujecie wyjaśnić działanie produktu, prawdopodobnie nie tędy droga.
Skuteczny tooltip przechodzi prosto do sedna i pozwala użytkownikom na
korzystanie z funkcji. Jeśli zastanawiacie się, czy użyć tooltipów warto zadać
sobie pytanie, czy informacje zawarte w podpowiedzi są niezbędne użytkownikowi
do wykonania zadania.</li>
<li>nie zapomnijcie o innych wytycznych projektowych (na przykład, oznaczania
ikon) – ważne informacje powinny zawsze znajdować się na stronie; dlatego
podpowiedzi nie powinny być niezbędne do wykonywania zadań, które użytkownicy
muszą wykonać w witrynie.</li>
</ul>

<p>Prawidłowo użyte tooltipy są niezwykle efektywną pomocą. Sprawiają, że
korzystanie z aplikacji jest płynne, profesjonalne i łatwe. Prowadzi to do
zadowalania użytkowników oraz buduje ich zaufanie do Waszego produktu. Mamy
nadzieję, że ten artykuł pozwolił Wam zapoznać się z różnymi sposobami tworzenia
kontekstowych i angażujących podpowiedzi.</p>
<p>Co tu dużo pisać, zachęcamy do komentowania i dzielenia się Waszymi
przemyśleniami.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>W ostatni weekend października 2024 rusza V edycja studiów podyplomowych na kierunku Komunikacja Techniczna. Na chętnych wciąż czekają miejsca. Czego nauczą się tegoroczni studenci? Szczegóły poniżej.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="studia-oczami-absolwentów">Studia oczami absolwentów<a href="https://techwriter.pl/v-edycja-studiow-komunikacja-techniczna-trwa-nabor#studia-oczami-absolwent%C3%B3w" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Studia oczami absolwentów" title="Bezpośredni link do Studia oczami absolwentów">​</a></h2>
<p>Jak w poprzednich latach, i w tym roku objęliśmy patronatem kierunek studiów <a href="https://www.vistula.edu.pl/kierunki-studiow/studia-podyplomowe/informatyka/komunikacja-techniczna" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Komunikacja Techniczna na Akademii Finansów i Biznesu Vistula</a>. Cieszy nas bardzo fakt, że dzięki poprzednim, bardzo pozytywnie odebranym przez absolwentów edycjom, studia te nadal wzbudzają spore zainteresowanie.</p>
<p>Zainteresowanych zachęcamy do przeczytania artykułów naszych redakcyjnych koleżanek, Magdy i Justyny, absolwentek tego kierunku, które dzielą się z Wami swoimi wrażeniami:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://techwriter.pl/komunikacja-techniczna-jak-sie-studiuje/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">po pierwszym semestrze</a></li>
<li><a href="http://techwriter.pl/komunikacja-techniczna-drugi-semestr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">po drugim semestrze</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techwriter.pl/kilka-slow-o-3-edycji-studiow-z-komunikacji-technicznej/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">o 3. edycji studiów</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Wiemy również, że część studentów znalazła pracę w trakcie lub zaraz po obronach prac, jak choćby <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pawel-woznikowski_this-is-probably-my-most-personal-professional-activity-7114579776916353024-kC8e/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paweł</a>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="co-pozostaje-a-co-się-zmienia">Co pozostaje, a co się zmienia<a href="https://techwriter.pl/v-edycja-studiow-komunikacja-techniczna-trwa-nabor#co-pozostaje-a-co-si%C4%99-zmienia" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Co pozostaje, a co się zmienia" title="Bezpośredni link do Co pozostaje, a co się zmienia">​</a></h2>
<p>Podobnie jak w poprzednich latach, prowadzący podążają za głosem studentów i wciąż udoskonalają program zajęć. Jako jeden z przykładów należy podać wydzielenie jako osobny blok tematyczny zagadnienia AI w komunikacji technicznej. Część zagadnień kursu została inaczej zgrupowana, by cały zakres studiów był bardziej spójny i klarowny.</p>
<p>Program studiów obejmuje również podstawowe zagadnienia z obszarów automatyzacji i użyteczności oraz praktycznie przygotowuje studentów do zdobycia certyfikatu ITCQF Foundation Level. W tym roku jednak nie wydzielono specjalnego bloku na kurs dedykowany certyfikatowi - materiał potrzebny do jego zdania został jednak uwzględniony w programie nauczania.</p>
<p>Wraz ze zmianami programu nastąpiła także zmiana kadry. Tym razem zespół szkolący zasilą: Aleksandra Wieczorek i Agata Rygielska.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="partnerzy">Partnerzy<a href="https://techwriter.pl/v-edycja-studiow-komunikacja-techniczna-trwa-nabor#partnerzy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Partnerzy" title="Bezpośredni link do Partnerzy">​</a></h2>
<p>Kierunek kontynuuje współpracę z University of North Carolina Wilmington. Studenci, wraz z kolegami i koleżankami z USA, mogą współpracować przy projektach prowadzonych w ramach kierunku „Writing in Intercultural and Global Contexts”. To doskonała okazja, by zdobyć nowe doświadczenie, nowe znajomości i wartościowy wpis do CV. Szczegóły <a href="https://www.craft.do/s/VOd7B47ytH4bhA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tutaj</a>.</p>
<p>Poza współpracą naukową z amerykańską uczelnią kierunek od lat wspierany jest przez wielu partnerów z branży (memoQ, MadCap oraz Atlassian). Dzięki temu uczestnicy zajęć mają możliwość poznania najpopularniejszych i często bardzo drogich narzędzi wykorzystywanych przez profesjonalnych technical writerów.</p>

<p>Studia są zdalne, mogą w nich brać udział osoby z dowolnego miejsca w Polsce i na świecie. Rekrutacja nadal trwa, więc jeśli jesteście zainteresowani to jest najwyższa pora, by złożyć aplikację.</p>
<p>Zajęcia trwają dwa semestry i kosztują 7800 zł. Na oba semestry organizatorzy przewidzieli 168 godzin wykładów i warsztatów. Każdy absolwent studiów będzie miał możliwość (za dodatkową opłatą wynoszącą 800 zł brutto) uzyskania międzynarodowego certyfikatu <a href="https://itcqf.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ITCQF</a> (Foundation Certificate in Technical Communication).</p>
<p>Komunikacja na studiach odbywa się na platformie Confluence, a wszystkie zadania śledzone są w Jira. Zajęcia prowadzone są na platformie Microsoft Teams. Projekty tworzone są przy użyciu MadCap Flare, Oxygena, czy narzędzi i technik wspierających DocAsCode.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Estymacja w IT jest dobrze wszystkim znana, szczególnie w świecie programistów. Dostępne są przeróżne metody dochodzenia do odpowiedzi na zasadnicze pytanie: ile potrzebuję czasu, żeby ukończyć to zadanie?</p>
<p>W świecie Technical Writerów sprawa wygląda nieco inaczej. Dostajemy funkcjonalność, którą trzeba opisać i nie wybieramy sobie zazwyczaj, że w danym sprincie sobie to opiszemy. Wynika to z tego, że może nas gonić termin releasu i po prostu musimy skończyć dane zadanie w określonym przedziale czasowym.</p>
<p>Wszyscy zasadniczo wiemy po co się estymuje - przynajmniej tak się wydaje. Jednak, żeby robić to rozsądnie, powinniśmy zastanowić się czy problemy, z którymi się borykamy mogą być rzeczywiście rozwiązane przy pomocy estymacji, czy lepiej szukać innego narzędzia?</p>
<p>W zależności od modelu, w którym pracujemy, estymacja może pomóc nam odpowiedzieć na pytanie: czy jestem w stanie realnie się zobowiązać, że wykonam to zadanie na czas?</p>
<p>Estymacja może też oferować bardziej przejrzyste i obiektywne kryteria raportowania ryzyka, czyli informacji, że jednak nie jestem w stanie dostarczyć dokumentacji zgodnie z wcześniejszą deklaracją.</p>
<p>Ponadto, możemy spróbować poszukać odpowiedzi na następujące pytania:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ile godzin tak naprawdę Technical Writer spędza na tworzeniu dokumentacji?</li>
<li>Czy zostaje czas na inne zajęcia, takie jak: szkolenia, ulepszanie istniejącej dokumentacji, czy inicjatywy wewnętrzne?</li>
</ul>
<p>Pośrednio, odpowiedzi na te pytania mogą pomóc w diagnozie, kiedy przydałoby się zatrudnić nową osobę oraz jak zmienia się nakład pracy w czasie.</p>
<p>Jako manager zespołu dokumentacyjnego, wielokrotnie zmagałam się z wyzwaniem określenia możliwości mojego zespołu.</p>
<p>Było to bardzo trudne, szczególnie, że pracowaliśmy w systemie <em>continous delivery</em>, a więc nie mieliśmy określonego czasu releasu, na przykład kwartalnego. Releasy funkcjonalności nad którymi pracowali pisarze mogły zdarzać się nawet kilka razy dziennie.</p>
<p>W moim zespole, który składa się z czterech Technical Writerów, każdy był odpowiedzialny za dokumentację z innego obszaru. Czasem terminy goniły tylko po to, żeby raptownie zwolnić po wykryciu nieoczekiwanych bugów w funkcjonalności.</p>
<p>Ciężko nam było też określić jak zmienia się nakład pracy z kwartału na kwartał. Proste porównanie ilości zamkniętych zadań na koniec kwartału nie było zbyt dokładne, ponieważ nie uwzględniało różnic w nakładzie pracy niezbędnym do ukończenia poszczególnych zadań.</p>
<p>Postanowiliśmy to ogarnąć 💪</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="proces">Proces<a href="https://techwriter.pl/estymacja#proces" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Proces" title="Bezpośredni link do Proces">​</a></h2>
<p>Inicjatywa wyszła ode mnie. Po szybkiej rozmowie z Agile Coachem, który pomógł mi nazwać i doprecyzować moje problemy, zabraliśmy się do pracy.</p>
<p>Pracę zorganizowaliśmy w formie warsztatu. Niestety, każdy z nas uczestniczył w tym warsztacie zdalnie, ale dzięki narzędziom do kolaboracji, daliśmy radę go skutecznie przeprowadzić.</p>
<p>Przyjęliśmy kilka założeń wyjściowych, które dla wszystkich były akceptowalne:</p>
<ul>
<li>Niektóre zadania dokumentacyjne wymagają więcej pracy niż inne.</li>
<li>Jesteśmy w stanie stworzyć listę czynności, które stale przewijają się w pracy każdego Writera.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="krok-1-lista-zadań-dokumentacyjnych">KROK 1: Lista zadań dokumentacyjnych<a href="https://techwriter.pl/estymacja#krok-1-lista-zada%C5%84-dokumentacyjnych" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do KROK 1: Lista zadań dokumentacyjnych" title="Bezpośredni link do KROK 1: Lista zadań dokumentacyjnych">​</a></h3>
<p>Stworzyliśmy listę różnych zadań dokumentacyjnych, które powtarzają się w naszej pracy. Na przykład:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nowy atrybut dodany do istniejącego endpointa w API</li>
<li>Customowy event Google Analytics</li>
<li>Ulepszenie istniejącej funkcjonalności</li>
<li>Nowe pole w aplikacji webowej wspierające nową funkcjonalność</li>
</ul>
<p>Do każdego z tych zadań dodaliśmy również stworzenie dokumentu Release Note, ponieważ każda zmiana w naszym produkcie wymagała bezpośredniego poinformowania klientów.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="krok-2-lista-czynności-które-powtarzają-się-w-naszej-pracy">KROK 2: Lista czynności, które powtarzają się w naszej pracy<a href="https://techwriter.pl/estymacja#krok-2-lista-czynno%C5%9Bci-kt%C3%B3re-powtarzaj%C4%85-si%C4%99-w-naszej-pracy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do KROK 2: Lista czynności, które powtarzają się w naszej pracy" title="Bezpośredni link do KROK 2: Lista czynności, które powtarzają się w naszej pracy">​</a></h3>
<p>Możemy zidentyfikować i wyodrębnić powtarzalne czynności w naszej pracy, które stanowią części składowe różnych zadań dokumentacyjnych.</p>
<p>Z pewnością zaraz po tym jak dowiesz się, że jest nowa funkcjonalność do opisania, nie zabierasz się za pisanie!</p>
<p>Co więc robisz?</p>
<p>Najpierw musisz się nieco rozeznać w temacie! A więc czytasz opis w Jirze lub innym systemie.
Potem z pewnością będziesz chciał choćby przez chwilę porozmawiać ze swoim SME, czy to z Product Managerem czy z Deweloperem, aby potwierdzić, że dobrze rozumiesz wymagania i dowiedzieć się czy mają coś więcej do dodania. Dopiero potem tworzysz pierwszy szkic swojego dokumentu. I tak dalej…</p>
<p>My też zabraliśmy się za tworzenie takiej listy. Umieściliśmy na niej między innymi:</p>
<ul>
<li>Własny research - na podstawie dostępnych informacji, czyli opisu w Jirze, różnych dokumentów i prezentacji, stworzonych przez Product Managera czy wręcz raportu z UX research.
Dodaliśmy tu również research domeny w Internecie, jeśli na przykład musisz napisać o nowej funkcji w obszarze SEO, o którym nic nie wiesz - dobrze by było trochę poczytać, prawda? 😉</li>
<li>Rozmowa z SME</li>
<li>Tworzenie projektu dokumentacji wraz z Release Note</li>
<li>Stworzenie nazwy dla nowego atrybutu w API lub pola w interfejsie</li>
<li>Sprawdzenie tekstów dodanych przez Deweloperów na nowych ekranach aplikacji</li>
<li>I tak dalej</li>
</ul>
<p>Naturalnie, nie każde zadanie wymaga zaliczenia wszystkich tych czynności. Niektóre zadania wymagają  ukończenia tylko kilku, inne, bardziej skomplikowane nawet kilkunastu. To wszystko oczywiście będzie zależało od specyfiki twojego produktu i sposobu pracy w danej firmie.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="krok-3-połączenie-zadań-z-czynnościami">KROK 3: Połączenie zadań z czynnościami<a href="https://techwriter.pl/estymacja#krok-3-po%C5%82%C4%85czenie-zada%C5%84-z-czynno%C5%9Bciami" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do KROK 3: Połączenie zadań z czynnościami" title="Bezpośredni link do KROK 3: Połączenie zadań z czynnościami">​</a></h3>
<p>Następnie wzięliśmy na warsztat każde z zadań dokumentacyjnych, jedno po drugim i przypisywaliśmy do każdego z nich listę czynności, które musi wykonać pisarz, aby ukończyć dane zadanie.</p>
<p>Każde zadanie opisaliśmy w takim formacie:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techwriter.pl/assets/images/img1-d6966be632bd059e4d162fdce764cf3c.jpg" width="652" height="395" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Do tej pory szło gładko, nie pojawiały się żadne kwestie sporne 😉</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="krok-4-dodanie-czynnika-czasu">KROK 4: Dodanie czynnika czasu<a href="https://techwriter.pl/estymacja#krok-4-dodanie-czynnika-czasu" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do KROK 4: Dodanie czynnika czasu" title="Bezpośredni link do KROK 4: Dodanie czynnika czasu">​</a></h3>
<p>W kolejnym kroku, mieliśmy podjąć próbę wyceny każdej czynności w kontekście zadania w ramach którego będzie wykonywana.</p>
<p>Oczywiście, jeśli mamy całkiem nową aplikację umożliwiającą klientom konfigurację jakiegoś obszaru, to czynność polegająca na sprawdzeniu <em>UI copy</em> zajmie znacznie dłużej niż w przypadku, gdy zespół dodał jedno nowe pole w istniejącym interfejsie.</p>
<p>Ku mojemu zaskoczeniu, i tu byliśmy całkiem zgodni. Tam gdzie pojawiały się rozbieżności, w stylu: "ale mi ta czynność zajmuje więcej czasu" - głosowaliśmy i wyciągaliśmy średnią.</p>
<p>Na koniec tego kroku, każde z zadań dokumentacyjnych mieliśmy opracowane mniej więcej w takiej postaci:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techwriter.pl/assets/images/img2-05c06686fb8b4de9d79439cd96933119.jpg" width="727" height="428" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="krok-5-zsumowanie-ilości-godzin-dla-każdego-zadania">KROK 5: Zsumowanie ilości godzin dla każdego zadania<a href="https://techwriter.pl/estymacja#krok-5-zsumowanie-ilo%C5%9Bci-godzin-dla-ka%C5%BCdego-zadania" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do KROK 5: Zsumowanie ilości godzin dla każdego zadania" title="Bezpośredni link do KROK 5: Zsumowanie ilości godzin dla każdego zadania">​</a></h3>
<p>Zsumowaliśmy czas zadeklarowany na wykonanie danego zadania.
Następnie ułożyliśmy nasze zdania dokumentacyjne w kolejności, od najmniej do najbardziej czasochłonnych.</p>
<p>Okazało się, że mamy typy zadań dokumentacyjnych, które zajmują odpowiednio: 3, 5, 15 i 25 godzin. No dobra, nie wyszło tak równo, trochę zaokrągliliśmy 😉</p>
<p>Użyliśmy rozmiarów koszulek (<em>t-shirt size</em>) i przyporządkowaliśmy każdemu rozmiarowi odpowiednią estymatę. W rezultacie otrzymaliśmy listę rozmiarów zadań z ich prawdopodobną czasochłonnością:</p>
<ul>
<li>XS - 3 godziny</li>
<li>S - 5 godzin</li>
<li>M - 15 godzin</li>
<li>L - 25 godzin</li>
</ul>
<p>Rozmiary koszulek były najbardziej intuicyjne, a dodatkowym atutem był fakt, że Jira pozwala na dodanie takiej estymacji z automatu, bez zbędnych zabiegów konfiguracyjnych.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="koszulki-w-praniu">Koszulki w praniu<a href="https://techwriter.pl/estymacja#koszulki-w-praniu" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Koszulki w praniu" title="Bezpośredni link do Koszulki w praniu">​</a></h2>
<p>Po warsztacie pełni zapału ruszyliśmy estymować. Dodatkowo uzgodniliśmy, że:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nie będziemy rejestrować godzin faktycznie spędzonych na danym zadaniu - wystarczy określić jaki to typ zadania dokumentacyjnego i przyporządkować mu rozmiar.
Uznaliśmy, że rejestrowanie godzin zbytnio nas obciąży, szczególnie gdy nasza praca wymaga częstego przełączania się między zadaniami.</li>
<li>Jeśli w trakcie pracy okaże się, że przeszacowaliśmy lub niedoszacowaliśmy, poprawialiśmy oryginalną estymatę tak, żeby była bliższa rzeczywistości.</li>
<li>Będziemy patrzeć na rezultaty kwartalnie.</li>
</ul>
<p>Po pierwszym kwartale wyszło nam, że potrafimy już zmierzyć ile czasu poświęciliśmy na zadania dokumentacyjne łącznie.</p>
<p>Po drugim kwartale zaobserwowaliśmy nie tylko znaczny wzrost zadań, ale też i ich rozmiarów.</p>
<p>Trzeci kwartał przyniósł nam więcej na temat tego ile średnio zadań i jakiej wielkości jesteśmy w stanie wykonać w ciągu kwartału.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="rekalibracja">Rekalibracja<a href="https://techwriter.pl/estymacja#rekalibracja" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Rekalibracja" title="Bezpośredni link do Rekalibracja">​</a></h3>
<p>Ponadto, ustaliliśmy z zespołem, że potrzebna będzie rekalibracja naszego oryginalnego systemu.
Na przykład doszliśmy do wniosku, że mamy za duży przeskok pomiędzy zadaniem S (5 godzin) a M (15 godzin).
Planujemy kolejny warsztat 😅</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tak-czy-nie-wnioski">Tak czy nie? (wnioski)<a href="https://techwriter.pl/estymacja#tak-czy-nie-wnioski" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Tak czy nie? (wnioski)" title="Bezpośredni link do Tak czy nie? (wnioski)">​</a></h2>
<p>Ten eksperyment nadal trwa, ale już stał się stałym elementem naszego procesu. Daje nam, jako zespołowi informacje, które z czasem będzie można wykorzystać w rozmowach z różnymi <em>stakeholderami</em>.</p>
<p>Znamy rozmiar zadań ukończonych i zadań w przygotowaniu oraz ich wartość godzinową.</p>
<p>Znamy również realne obłożenie pracą - w wymiarze godzinowym. To daje nam możliwość dalszej analizy, czy to się wszystko jeszcze spina, po uwzględnieniu liczby godzin dostępnych na pracę (odejmując urlopy, spotkania zespołowe, 1:1, itd.).</p>
<p>Nadal jednak, zaczynając nowy kwartał nie mamy pełnej pewności jak ostatecznie się on rozwinie. Budowa produktu przebiega wielotorowo i często zależymy od precyzji planowania i estymacji zespołów produktowych i deweloperskich.</p>
<p>Co innego w krótszej perspektywie, kiedy wiemy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ile mamy dostępnego czasu Technical Writera?</li>
<li>Ile jakiego typu zadań jest do udokumentowania?</li>
<li>Na kiedy?</li>
</ul>
<p>Wtedy jak najbardziej możemy lepiej określić czy jest ryzyko opóźnień, czy też damy radę zrealizować wszystko na czas.</p>
<p>Estymacja może być niezwykle przydatnym procesem, jeśli wiemy po co chcemy ją wdrożyć. W naszym przypadku, pierwotna potrzeba czyli zdolność określenia czy zobowiązujemy się do dostarczenia dokumentacji okazała się niemożliwa w perspektywie kwartału, ale zadziałała w kontekście krótszych ram czasowych i bliższych deadlinów.</p>
<p>Dodatkowo mamy mocne, obiektywne, bo oparte na danych argumenty przydatne w przypadku rozmów dotyczących zatrudnienia nowych Writerów.</p>
<p>Pewnym nieplanowanym elementem było również to, że zespół miał okazję wspólnie skatalogować i przedyskutować każdy typ zadania dokumentacyjnego, wypowiedzieć się na temat czasu jaki im on zajmuje, porównać swoje argumenty z innymi i wymienić się <em>best practices</em> na optymalizację poszczególnych etapów 🙌</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pierwszy <strong>#ContentDay</strong> już za nami, czas więc na krótkie podsumowanie :)
Czerwcowe wydarzenie odwiedziła spora grupa contentowych pasjonatów, a sale
Uniwersytetu Jagiellońskiego pozwoliły nam na przeprowadzenie warsztatów i
prezentacji.</p>
<p>Nie zabrakło również czasu na networking, wymianę doświadczeń i opinii.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="warsztaty">Warsztaty<a href="https://techwriter.pl/meet-content-krk-content-day-podsumowanie#warsztaty" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Warsztaty" title="Bezpośredni link do Warsztaty">​</a></h2>
<p>Dzień rozpoczęliśmy od warsztatów prowadzonych przez dwóch Pawłów.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pawel-kowaluk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Paweł Kowaluk</strong></a> wprowadził nas w
tajniki Design Thinking. Podczas pracy nad projektem o nazwie <strong>Smart Home</strong>,
prowadziliśmy wywiady z użytkownikami oraz stworzyliśmy personę, a całość
zwieńczyliśmy projektem strony z dokumentacją. W trakcie warsztatów poznaliśmy
założenia metody Design Thinking i nauczyliśmy się, jak można wykorzystać je w
swoich projektach.</p>
<p>Z kolei <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pawelchlodnicki/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Paweł Chłodnicki</strong></a>
wykorzystał swoją wiedzę designera i pokazał nam jak zaprojektować aplikację
mobilną. Tworząc swój pierwszy prototyp, mieliśmy szansę zapoznać się z
funkcjonalnościami Figmy.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="visual-design-w-komunikacji-technicznej">Visual design w komunikacji technicznej<a href="https://techwriter.pl/meet-content-krk-content-day-podsumowanie#visual-design-w-komunikacji-technicznej" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Visual design w komunikacji technicznej" title="Bezpośredni link do Visual design w komunikacji technicznej">​</a></h2>
<p>Po warsztatach i przerwie nadszedł czas na drugą część programu, czyli
prezentacje.</p>
<p>Rozpoczęliśmy od omówienia roli projektów graficznych w dokumentacji.
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maciekchudanski/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maciek Chudański</a> pokazał nam jak
ważna jest graficzna prezentacja treści, obrazów, rysunków i schematów.</p>
<p>Zasady dotyczące tworzenia grafik Maciek zilustrował wieloma przykładami. Między
innymi, dowiedzieliśmy się jaką rolę elementy wizualne odgrywają w dokumentacji,
jak dobór elementów wiąże się z kontekstem kulturowym, a także jak dokumentacja
którą czytamy na ekranie różni się od tej drukowanej.</p>
<p>Mnóstwo przykładów i porównań zawartych w prezentacji spotkało się z
zainteresowaniem publiczności oraz wieloma pytaniami.</p>
<p>A jeżeli chcesz dowiedzieć się więcej o prezentacji Maćka, zapraszamy na

<p>Następna prezentacja również obfitowała w grafiki i diagramy ilustrujące wyniki
projektu <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/monika-mrozek/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moniki Mrozek</a> i jej
zespołu. Monika opowiedziała nam jak wraz z zespołem przeanalizowała codzienne
zadania, aby oszacować pracę technical writera i prognozować obłożenie
zadaniami.</p>
<p>Dodatkowym benefitem tego projektu było zdobycie argumentów przemawiających za
rozszerzeniem zespołu.</p>
<p>Jako że nie była to pierwsza prezentacja Moniki na ten temat, możecie zapoznać
się ze szczegółami

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="stowarzyszenie-autorów-i-ilustratorów-technicznych">Stowarzyszenie Autorów i Ilustratorów Technicznych<a href="https://techwriter.pl/meet-content-krk-content-day-podsumowanie#stowarzyszenie-autor%C3%B3w-i-ilustrator%C3%B3w-technicznych" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Stowarzyszenie Autorów i Ilustratorów Technicznych" title="Bezpośredni link do Stowarzyszenie Autorów i Ilustratorów Technicznych">​</a></h2>
<p>Po krótkiej przerwie poświęconej networkingowi przy kawie i ciasteczkach
powróciliśmy do sali, żeby posłuchać o <strong>Stowarzyszeniu Autorów i Ilustratorów
Technicznych</strong>.
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/%C5%82ukasz-rybka-364a81190/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Łukasz Rybka</a>
wystąpił z propozycją utworzenia stowarzyszenia gromadzącego twórców treści i
ilustracji, które miałoby na celu nie tylko stworzenie wspólnych standardów i
najlepszych praktyk w zakresie tworzenia treści, ale także ochronę i promocję
technical writerów i designerów.</p>
<p>Prezentację zakończyliśmy dyskusją na temat założeń stowarzyszenia oraz kroków,
które należy podjąć, żeby wdrożyć je w życie.</p>
<p>Więcej o <strong>SAiIT Polska</strong> możecie przeczytać w
<a href="https://techwriter.pl/saiit-wywiad" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wywiadzie udzielonym przez Łukasza</a> oraz

<p><strong>#ContentDay</strong> stawia nie tylko na merytorykę, ale także na humor.</p>
<p>Dlatego też krótkie wystąpienie
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jan-sosna/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jana Sosny</strong></a> poświęcone żartom z AI
spotkało się z niezwykle entuzjastycznym przyjęciem.</p>
<p>Janowi wróżymy karierę w stand-upie i czekamy na więcej!</p>

<p>Wydarzenie zakończyliśmy patrząc na content z perspektywy UX designerów.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominikalacheta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dominika Łacheta</a> opowiedziała
nam o wyzwaniach, jakie stoją przed UX designerami projektującymi oprogramowanie
przyjazne użytkownikom.</p>
<p>Dominika przybliżyła nam różnice w wykorzystaniu oprogramowania przez
indywidualnych użytkowników i duże przedsiębiorstwa, co przekłada się na proces
projektowania oprogramowania. Następnie przeszliśmy wspólnie przez etapy
projektu od rozpoznania potrzeb użytkownika, aż po dostarczenie rozwiązania. To
pozwoliło nam zrozumieć co dla UX designera może być wyzwaniem oraz jak takim
wyzwaniom sprostać.</p>
<p>Prezentację dodatkowo wzbogaciły liczne memy, bo w końcu:</p>
<p><em>Interfejs użytkownika jest jak żart - jeżeli trzeba go tłumaczyć, to znaczy, że
nie jest trafiony</em>.</p>

<p>Wszystkim uczestnikom serdecznie dziękujemy za liczne przybycie! Cieszymy się,
że razem tworzymy wspaniałą contentową społeczność, która poprzez spotkania i
wymianę doświadczeń ma szansę na rozwój i kształtowanie podejścia do tworzenia

<p>Dziękujemy naszym prezenterom oraz trenerom za poświęcony czas i chęć dzielenia
się swoją wiedzą z uczestnikami. Dziękujemy także doktorowi <strong>Andrzejowi
Kurtyce</strong> z Uniwersytetu Jagiellońskiego za pomoc w organizacji wydarzenia, gdyż

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Czy autorzy techniczni stanowią osobną grupę zawodową? 🤔 Dla wszystkich pracujących w tej branży z pewnością odpowiedź jest oczywista 💡</p>
<p>Okazuje się jednak, że poza branżą nie jest to już takie pewne. W Polsce Technical Writerzy nie są postrzegani w kategoriach samodzielnej profesji. Nasza praca często zaliczana jest do bardziej ogólnej kategorii: "usługi w sektorze IT".</p>
<p>A to niesie za sobą pewne konsekwencje.</p>
<p>I o tym dziś będziemy rozmawiać z <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/%C5%82ukasz-rybka-364a81190/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Łukaszem Rybką</a>, pomysłodawcą i założycielem Stowarzyszenia Autorów i Ilustratorów Technicznych (SAIiT), który działa bardzo aktywnie, promując ideę stowarzyszenia wśród społeczności dokumentalistów.</p>

<p>Najtrudniejsze pytanie na początek? 🙂 Zawodowo przygodę z dokumentacją techniczną zacząłem w 2011 roku. Swoje pierwsze kroki w tej branży stawiałem w firmie Whirlpool, gdzie tworzyliśmy instrukcje do zmywarek, zarządzaliśmy tłumaczeniami, rysunkami czy sprawdzaliśmy prawidłowość zamówień, tak zwanych <em>BOMów</em> (BOM materiałowy to z angielskiego <em>Bill of Materials</em>, czyli dokument opisujący wszystkie niezbędne środki do wykonania konkretnego procesu produkcyjnego), itp.</p>
<p>Tam zetknąłem się z procesami okołoprodukcyjnymi w dużej firmie. W 2017 roku zacząłem pracę w firmie Etteplan, gdzie zajmowałem się różnymi rodzajami dokumentacji a także outsourcingiem dokumentacji technicznej. W ciągu tych prawie 7 lat było mi dane pracować z dokumentacją do niezliczonej liczby urządzeń, oprogramowania i maszyn. To też była przygoda z wieloma narzędziami do tworzenia i zarządzania treścią. Od tych najprostszych, aż po wielkie “kombajny” 🙂</p>
<p>Od marca br. prowadzę własną działalność gospodarczą w zakresie tworzenia dokumentacji, doradzam klientom w tej dziedzinie i prowadzę szkolenia z zakresu obsługi oprogramowania i pisania.</p>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="opowiedz-nam-o-początkach-projektu-stowarzyszenia-jak-to-się-stało-że-zacząłeś-myśleć-o-takiej-formie-organizacyjnej">Opowiedz nam o początkach projektu stowarzyszenia.

Jak to się stało, że zacząłeś myśleć o takiej formie organizacyjnej?">​</a></h3>
<p>Moje pierwsze pomysły powstania takiego stowarzyszenia narodziły się w 2017 roku, gdy okazało się, że zawód autora technicznego w Polsce formalnie nie istnieje.</p>
<p>Z tego powodu, nie do końca jasne było, jak zakwalifikować naszą profesję i ją zgłosić do Urzędu Pracy czy do ZUS. Kiedy ktoś pytał o mój zawód, odpowiedź niejednokrotnie wywoływała zdziwienie w oczach ludzi: co to za profesja?</p>
<p>Pamiętam, jak wiele trudności sprawiało i nadal sprawia, rekrutowanie. Spore rozbieżności w nazywaniu stanowisk potrafią wyprowadzić z równowagi niejedną osobę z dużym doświadczeniem w rekrutacji. Pamiętam jak wiele czasu i rozmów poświęciliśmy w zespole na wypracowanie standardów i kryteriów jakie powinni spełniać kandydaci na stanowisko autora technicznego.</p>
<p>Wiele problemów przyniosła zmiana interpretacji “pracy twórczej” przez Krajową Administrację Skarbową (KAS), kilka lat temu. Okazało się, że są duże rozbieżności w interpretowaniu pracy specjalisty, w zależności od głównej działalności firmy, czy projektu. Nie było, i nadal nie ma spójnego stanowiska w tej sprawie.</p>
<p>W 2019 postanowiłem zająć się tym problemem w mojej pracy licencjackiej, w której przeprowadziłem analizę problematyki prawa autorskiego w pracy specjalisty od dokumentacji. Pozwoliło mi to na dogłębną ocenę sytuacji prawnej zawodu autora technicznego w Polsce i porównać ją do sytuacji w innych krajach, takich jak Niemcy, Włochy, Francja, gdzie ten zawód posiada długoletnią tradycję.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="forma">Forma<a href="https://techwriter.pl/saiit-wywiad#forma" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Forma" title="Bezpośredni link do Forma">​</a></h2>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="dlaczego-forma-stowarzyszenia-i-czym-ono-będzie-się-zajmować">Dlaczego forma stowarzyszenia i czym ono będzie się zajmować?<a href="https://techwriter.pl/saiit-wywiad#dlaczego-forma-stowarzyszenia-i-czym-ono-b%C4%99dzie-si%C4%99-zajmowa%C4%87" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Dlaczego forma stowarzyszenia i czym ono będzie się zajmować?" title="Bezpośredni link do Dlaczego forma stowarzyszenia i czym ono będzie się zajmować?">​</a></h3>
<p>Jest to obecnie najszybsza i najprostsza droga do zarejestrowania profesji w “Wykazie zawodów” Ministerstwa Pracy. To na jego podstawie ZUS kwalifikuje zawody po swojej stronie.</p>
<p>Stowarzyszenie jest też formą najbardziej demokratyczną w wyborze klasyfikacji umiejętności zawodowych, bo nie ukrywajmy, w tej profesji każdy z nas jest “skądś”. Nikt z nas nie wykształcił się od razu w kierunku autora czy ilustratora technicznego.</p>
<p>Od paru lat obserwuję działania organizacji <a href="https://itcqf.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ITCQF</a> w kierunku propagowania zawodu autora technicznego i próby odpowiedzi na rzeczywiste potrzeby rynku w tym kierunku. Jako stowarzyszenie, możemy efektywniej wpływać na świadomość pracodawców w obszarze potrzeb związanych z dokumentacją techniczną.</p>
<p>Będziemy mieli większą siłę przebicia w przypadku ustandaryzowania nazwy zawodu, kwalifikacji potrzebnych do jego wykonywania, znajomości metodyk, a co za tym idzie ustandaryzowania stawek za wykonywaną pracę.</p>
<p>Z pewnością warto również nawiązać współpracę z pokrewnymi organizacjami z naszej branży, na przykład z Tekom, które jest obecnie największym stowarzyszeniem autorów technicznych w Europie. Z pewnością miłe też będzie posiadać własną konferencję lub być częścią działań takich jak <em>soap!</em></p>

<p>Obecnie z kilkoma osobami pracujemy nad statutem stowarzyszenia. Jest to pierwszy krok niezbędny do jego rejestracji w sądzie.</p>
<p>Im więcej osób byłoby zaangażowanych w nagłośnienie sprawy lub w pomoc promującą inicjatywę w social mediach - tym lepiej.</p>
<p>Serdecznie więc zapraszam do kontaktu. Obecnie staram się ogarnąć to sam, a doba ma niestety tylko 24h.</p>

<p>Z pewnością chcemy ustandaryzować zawód dokumentalisty i ilustratora technicznego.</p>
<p>Jak wiemy z doświadczenia czy rozmów prowadzonych na spotkaniach branżowych, wiele firm działa trochę po omacku i zakres obowiązków Technical Writera często bardzo różni się pomiędzy firmami.</p>
<p>Wydarzenia  organizowane przez <em>MeetContent</em> lub <em>soap!</em> pozwalają na dużą wymianę wiedzy i doświadczeń, ale takie podejście się nie skaluje ani nie wspiera powszechnej adopcji dobrych praktyk.</p>
<p>Zauważyłem, że jest rozbieżność w prowadzeniu projektów w zależności od rodzaju produktu, dla jakiego powstaje dokumentacja. Inaczej pisze się dokumentację dla oprogramowania, a inaczej dla przemysłu maszynowego, precyzyjnego czy AGD. O takiej wisience na torcie, jak branża lotnicza czy militarna nie wspomina się wcale, a wiele standardów przyszło właśnie z tamtej strony. Z pewnością przyda się uświadamianie, że autor techniczny nie powinien się ograniczać do jednej branży czy produktu. To nie one cechują umiejętności.</p>
<p>To jest trochę, jak z szewcem. Szewc na podstawie zdobytej wiedzy, potrafi zrobić czy naprawić każdy rodzaj buta. To, czy dany szewc specjalizuje się w mokasynach, a inny w szpilkach to już ich wybór. Obaj jednak potrafią naprawić i zrobić każdy but.</p>
<p>Niektórzy autorzy nie czują się dobrze poza swoim ogródkiem i uważają że skoro pisali dla softu, to nie napiszą instrukcji dla piekarnika. Z własnego doświadczenia wiem, że to duży mit i warto go obalić.</p>
<p>Rozwój sztucznej inteligencji, trochę kładzie się cieniem na naszą profesję, ale tutaj pozostaję optymistą, co do przyszłości naszego zawodu. Ktoś tą niepokorną AI musi jakoś wytresować i nakarmić odpowiednimi treściami.</p>
<p>Wiemy jak zarządzać metadanymi i sądzę, że to właśnie jest przyszłość naszego zawodu, ale nie wybiegajmy zanadto w przyszłość.
Stowarzyszenie ma głównie pomagać autorom i ilustratorom aby podnosić ich kompetencje twarde, w taki sposób aby potrafili sobie poradzić w każdej z branż, która potrzebuje dokumentacji.</p>

<p>No cóż, przynależność do swego rodzaju elity zawodowej sama w sobie jest korzyścią 🙂</p>
<p>Jak już wspominałem wcześniej, będąc członkiem stowarzyszenia, będzie nam łatwiej reprezentować całą grupę zawodową niż występować osobno do instytucji w kraju, by reprezentować swoje interesy.</p>
<p>Lepiej lobbuje się w grupie, niż samemu, a im nas więcej, tym bardziej jesteśmy widoczni jako grupa zawodowa z bogatym doświadczeniem i wysoko wyspecjalizowaną wiedzą. Bycie członkiem stowarzyszenia daje też realny wpływ na tworzenie standardów, które ułatwią pracodawcom ustalenie zakresu obowiązków i wymaganych umiejętności.</p>
<p>Poza tym stowarzyszenie jest też formą wsparcia zawodowego czy prawnego dla jego członka.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="rodzaje-członków-stowarzyszenia">Rodzaje członków stowarzyszenia<a href="https://techwriter.pl/saiit-wywiad#rodzaje-cz%C5%82onk%C3%B3w-stowarzyszenia" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Rodzaje członków stowarzyszenia" title="Bezpośredni link do Rodzaje członków stowarzyszenia">​</a></h2>

<p>Obecnie jest to koncept, który będzie pewnie podlegał modyfikacjom. Sami musimy ustalić, czy taka różnorodność w rodzaju członkostwa jest potrzebna.</p>
<p>Projektowany statut przewiduje kilka rodzajów członkostwa w stowarzyszeniu:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Zwykłe</strong> - Tu wymagane będzie minimum trzyletnie doświadczenie w zawodzie autora lub ilustratora technicznego. Posiadając taki rodzaj członkostwa mamy pewność, że nasze interesy są odpowiednio reprezentowane przez stowarzyszenie. Mamy też realny wpływ na działalność stowarzyszenia przez głosowanie na walnym zgromadzeniu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Nadzwyczajne/specjalne</strong> - Daje te same prawa co członkostwo zwykłe, warunkiem jest jednak posiadanie dłuższego stażu pracy w zawodzie (z pewnością będziemy dyskutować nad stażem dłuższym niż 5 lat) i odpowiednio wysokimi kwalifikacjami.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Honorowe</strong> - Ten rodzaj członkostwa nadawany jest przez stowarzyszenie i jest przewidziane dla osób czynnie wspierających jego działania. Jest przeznaczone dla osób, które nie są autorami lub ilustratorami technicznymi. Takie członkostwo jest bardziej opiniotwórcze i symboliczne, nie daje ono prawa głosu na walnym zgromadzeniu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wspierające</strong> - Członkostwo wspierające jest stworzone z myślą o instytucjach lub organizacjach posiadających osobowość prawną, które będą wspierały stowarzyszenie medialnie czy finansowo. Oczywiście takie członkostwo jest pozbawione możliwości udziału i głosowaniu w walnym zgromadzeniu.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Jak już wspomniałem czeka nas jeszcze praca nad wieloma aspektami statutu, więc niektóre z rodzajów członkostwa mogą ulec zmianie.</p>

<p>Z pewnością zbliża się spotkanie na którym będziemy dyskutować o zapisach statutu i myślę że nastąpi to po wakacjach. Jeżeli się uda, to wstępnie do końca roku powinniśmy zdążyć z założeniem stowarzyszenia.</p>
<p>Zapraszam wszystkich chętnych do współdziałania.</p>
<p>Zawsze jest tak, że ktoś musi zacząć, a potem wszystko nabiera rozpędu 😉</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kolejny rok i kolejna Konferencja Tłumaczy (KTLC). Już od kilku lat jesteśmy jej
dumnym patronem - nie inaczej jest w tym roku.</p>
<p>Poza patronatem również aktywnie uczestniczymy w konferencji (czasami nawet jako
prelegenci i prelegentki). Dlatego możemy ją Wam polecić z absolutnym spokojem o
wysoką merytoryczną jakość oraz świetną atmosferę.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="gdzie-i-kiedy"><strong>Gdzie i kiedy?</strong><a href="https://techwriter.pl/konferencja-tlumaczy-2024#gdzie-i-kiedy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do gdzie-i-kiedy" title="Bezpośredni link do gdzie-i-kiedy">​</a></h2>
<p>Tegoroczna edycja <a href="https://konferencjatlumaczy.pl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Konferencji Tłumaczy</a>
odbędzie się 28 września w Warszawie, a towarzyszyć jej będzie
<a href="https://translation-conference.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Translation and Localization Conference</a> –
dwudniowe wydarzenie, zaplanowane na 27-28 września. Każde z wydarzeń ma osobny
program i osobną listę prelegentów - obie propozycje w równym stopniu godne
polecenia. Podobnie jak w ubiegłym roku, konferencja będzie miała formę
hybrydową: stacjonarnie w Golden Tulip Warsaw Center oraz online na platformie
Gridaly.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="dodatkowe-atrakcje"><strong>Dodatkowe atrakcje</strong><a href="https://techwriter.pl/konferencja-tlumaczy-2024#dodatkowe-atrakcje" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do dodatkowe-atrakcje" title="Bezpośredni link do dodatkowe-atrakcje">​</a></h2>
<p>Organizatorzy zadbali także o imprezy towarzyszące - warto przybyć do Warszawy
już w czwartek, 26 września, wypić powitalnego drinka i wziąć udział w panelu
dyskusyjnym. W niedzielę natomiast, po zakończeniu części merytorycznej, na
uczestniczki i uczestników czeka gra miejska i zwiedzanie stolicy.</p>

<p>Konferencja, jak sama nazwa sugeruje, jest adresowana do osób związanych z
szeroko pojętą branżą tłumaczeniową, zajmujących się pracą z tekstem i językiem,
przedstawicieli biur tłumaczeniowych, filologów, prawników, naukowców, twórców
narzędzi CAT. Mile widziani są oczywiście tech writerzy oraz specjaliści od
lokalizacji produktu. Wstępna lista prelegentów dostępna jest
<a href="https://konferencja-tlumaczy.pl/?page_id=2121" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pod tym linkiem</a>. Z
doświadczenia wiemy, że program konferencji jest na tyle urozmaicony, że każdy
znajdzie coś dla siebie.</p>

<p>Czy boisz się zmian i oswajasz je powoli? A może wręcz przeciwnie, jesteś
człowiekiem zmiany i wierzysz, że twoja branża może na niej zyskać? Tegoroczna
edycja jest właśnie dla Was, ponieważ jej temat przewodni to:</p>
<p><strong>Ludzie (!) Zmiany (!) – Ludzie zmiany!</strong></p>
<p>Jak rozumieć ten motyw? Pomyśl o poniższych zagadnieniach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jakie zmiany obserwujecie w swoim otoczeniu zawodowym w ostatnim roku?</li>
<li>Czy te zmiany były do przewidzenia, czy też Was zaskoczyły?</li>
<li>Jak możemy być katalizatorami zmian?</li>
<li>Jak być „ludźmi zmian”, którzy wyprzedzają rzeczywistość, by ją kształtować?</li>
<li>Gdzie w naszej zmieniającej się rzeczywistości zawodowej są ludzie i ludzkie
umiejętności?</li>
<li>A może nie takie te zmiany straszne, jak je malują?</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>22 maja spotkaliśmy się biurze firmy Etteplan.  #28 MeetContentWRO i tym razem składał się z dwóch prezentacji.</p>
<p>Na pierwszy ogień poszła <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/barbara-kardel-piatkowska/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Basia Kardel-Piątkowska</a>, która opowiedziała nam o transferze i retencji wiedzy w zespole dokumentacyjnym.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="transfer-i-retencja-wiedzy">Transfer i retencja wiedzy<a href="https://techwriter.pl/meet-content-wro-maj-2024-relacja#transfer-i-retencja-wiedzy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Transfer i retencja wiedzy" title="Bezpośredni link do Transfer i retencja wiedzy">​</a></h2>
<p>Basia zaczęła od nakreślenia specyficznych warunków, w jakich pracują Tech Writerzy w Etteplan. Firma świadczy usługi dokumentacyjne dla innych firm. Czasem jest to dokumentacja do urządzeń lub maszyn, a czasem do oprogramowania. Specyfika pracy Tech Writerów polega na tym, że są przypisywani do różnych projektów lub produktów. Bywa, że projekty lub produkty zmieniają się dość często.</p>
<p>Oznacza to, że transfer i retencja wiedzy między dokumentalistami stają się kluczowe. Oczywiście, nietrudno sobie wyobrazić, że zachowanie wiedzy i jej skuteczne przekazywanie są konieczne w każdej organizacji.</p>
<p>Basia zaczęła od zdefiniowania, czym jest wiedza. Metafora góry lodowej była bardzo pomocna, gdyż wiedza to jedynie jej przysłowiowy „czubek”.</p>
<p>Najniższa warstwa, zazwyczaj niewidoczna, to <strong>dane</strong> (raw data). Ponad tą warstwą znajdują się <strong>informacje</strong>. Dopiero na samym szczycie jest <strong>wiedza</strong>.</p>
<p>Pozostając przy metaforach, Basia wyjaśniła, że wiedza może mieć różne rodzaje:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wiedza jawna (<em>explicit</em>) - to przykładowo przepis na pizzę z ogólnodostępnej książki kucharskiej lub internetu</li>
<li>Wiedza niejawna (<em>implicit</em>) - to specjalne sposoby lub sztuczki, które można zastosować żeby ciasto było lepsze</li>
<li>Wiedza milcząca (<em>tacit</em>) -  to tajna receptura na ciasto od babci Francesci 🙃</li>
</ul>
<p>Na wiedzę zgromadzoną w organizacji czyha wiele niebezpieczeństw. Mogą to być na przykład:</p>
<ul>
<li>Utrata - nieoczekiwana choroba lub dłuższa nieobecność pracownika</li>
<li>Zagarnianie lub gromadzenie - (<em>knowledge hoarding</em>) - kiedy jeden pracownik gromadzi wiedzę dla siebie i nie chce się dzielić z innymi</li>
<li>Utrata produktywności - czyli kiedy wiedza nie jest udostępniania i dochodzi do sytuacji, kiedy zespoły i ich członkowie zaczynają wymyślać koło na nowo</li>
</ul>
<p>Basia miała kilka rad, jak można zapobiegać tym niebezpieczeństwom, lub przynajmniej ograniczyć ich skutki, jeśli już się wydarzą:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zidentyfikowanie kluczowych lub strategicznych obszarów wiedzy</li>
<li>Zidentyfikowanie braków w tej wiedzy</li>
<li>Mapowanie wiedzy, np. w postaci mapy projektu</li>
<li>Exit plan - czyli ustrukturyzowany plan na uzyskanie wiedzy od odchodzącego pracownika</li>

</ul>
<p>Uczestnicy mieli sporo pytań do Basi. Jak nietrudno się domyślić, wielu z nas boryka się z podobnymi problemami w naszych organizacjach.</p>
<p>Pytania dotyczyły polecanych narzędzi. I tu padło kilka nazw. Jednak po krótkiej dyskusji uczestnicy zgodzili się, że nawet najlepsze narzędzia nie zastąpią kultury pielęgnowania wiedzy i zachowania informacji w organizacji.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="visual-design-w-komunikacji-technicznej">Visual Design w komunikacji technicznej<a href="https://techwriter.pl/meet-content-wro-maj-2024-relacja#visual-design-w-komunikacji-technicznej" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Visual Design w komunikacji technicznej" title="Bezpośredni link do Visual Design w komunikacji technicznej">​</a></h2>
<p>Druga prezentacja tego wieczoru dotyczyła strony wizualnej dokumentacji. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maciekchudanski/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maciek Chudański</a> opowiedział (i pokazał 😀) nam jak ważna jest graficzna prezentacja treści, obrazów, rysunków i schematów.</p>
<p>Maciek zdobył publiczność już na samym początku odważną tezą, że projektowanie graficzne kroczy <strong>PRZED</strong> słowem pisanym: otóż pokazał nam malunki naścienne w jaskini, uważane za najstarsze rysunki wykonane przez człowieka.</p>
<p>Potem było już tylko lepiej 😀</p>
<p>W Etteplan, sekcja visual design nie ma łatwo. Grafikę trzeba dosłownie zsynchronizować z dokumentacją, umieścić ja w kontekście układu strony, wziąć pod uwagę możliwe formaty i przewidzieć warunki, w jakich dokumentacja może być użytkowana.</p>
<p>Graficzna warstwa zwykle przygotowywana jest z myślą o nośniku, czyli trzeba podjąć decyzję, czy projektuje się pod ekran czy papier.</p>
<p>Maciek mówił o podstawowej zasadzie: im oszczędniej z efektami wizualnymi, tym lepiej dla czytelności dokumentacji. Co za tym idzie, wystarczą de facto 4 kolory: czerwony, żółty, niebieski i zielony, żeby stworzyć grafiki do dokumentacji technicznej i przekazać każdy rodzaj komunikatu.</p>
<p>Podstawowe zasady dobrej grafiki w dokumentacji technicznej to duży kontrast, który zwiększa dostępność i ułatwia odbiór tekstu.
Lepiej również używać przeciwstawnych barw, niż pochodzących z tej samej palety.</p>
<p>Jednak kolory bywają zależne od kontekstu kulturowego. Przykładowo, niebieski w kręgu kultury zachodniej wzbudza zaufanie, podczas gdy czerwony ogólnie odbierany jest jako odpowiedni do zakomunikowania zagrożenia. Tak już jednak nie jest na przykład w kulturze azjatyckiej, co dodaje kompleksowości w różnorodnych projektach realizowanych w Etteplan.</p>
<p>Jak się jednak okazuje, wszystkie zasady, którym powinna podlegać dobra dokumentacja papierowa tracą swoją moc, jeśli zmienimy nośnik.
W przypadku dokumentacji przeznaczonej na ekran, prawdziwym game changerem okazuje się RUCH. Obiekty w ruchu zawsze wygrywają walkę o uwagę użytkownika.</p>
<p>Maciek opowiedział nam też o projektowaniu graficznym opartym o siatkę, gdzie każdy element ma swoje miejsce. Tego typu podejście sprawia, że dokumentacja jest bardziej ustrukturyzowana, czytelna i przewidywalna dla użytkownika.</p>
<p>Prezentacja, jak nietrudno się domyślić, obfitowała w wizualne przykłady idealnie obrazując różnice między czytelne - nieczytelne.</p>
<hr>
<p>Tym samym wrocławski MeetContent zakończył sezon 😀</p>
<p>Powracamy już we wrześniu z nową porcją wiedzy, praktyki i doświadczeń!</p>
<p>Dziękujemy Wam za uczestnictwo i do zobaczenia po wakacjach! 🌴 👋</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Generator stron statycznych stworzony z myślą o dokumentacji. Czy się faktycznie
nadaje? Oto nasze wrażenia.</p>
<!-- -->
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="co-to-jest-docusaurus">Co to jest Docusaurus?<a href="https://techwriter.pl/docusaurus-zielony-przyjaciel#co-to-jest-docusaurus" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Co to jest Docusaurus?" title="Bezpośredni link do Co to jest Docusaurus?">​</a></h2>
<p>Docusaurus to Static Site Generator, czyli aplikacja do generowania stron
statycznych. Przedstawicielem tej grupy jest na przykład
<a href="https://www.dita-ot.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DITA OT</a>, ale jest ich
<a href="https://jamstack.org/generators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">znacznie więcej</a>. Podobnie jak DITA OT,
Docusaurus został stworzony do dokumentacji, ale nie ma on nic wspólnego z ditą.
W Docusaurusie piszemy w formacie Markdown, a konkretnie MDX.</p>
<p>W dużym skrócie, projekt strony z Docusaurusem ma folder "docs" w którym piszemy
swoje strony (topiki, artykuły) i plik, który pozwala nam zarządzać nawigacją.</p>
<p>Jeżeli korzystacie z narzędzi wokół programowania front-end, to na pewno
widzieliście już Docusaurusa, na przykład na stronie
<a href="https://yarnpkg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yarn</a> albo
<a href="https://testing-library.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing Library</a>. Jeżeli nie, to może
zauważyliście, że (w momencie publikacji tego artykułu) Docusaurus zasila strony
<a href="https://meetcontent.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MeetContent</a> i stronę, którą aktualnie czytasz.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="dlaczego-do-dokumentacji">Dlaczego do dokumentacji?<a href="https://techwriter.pl/docusaurus-zielony-przyjaciel#dlaczego-do-dokumentacji" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Dlaczego do dokumentacji?" title="Bezpośredni link do Dlaczego do dokumentacji?">​</a></h2>
<p>Docusaurus od początku był stworzony z myślą o dokumentacji do projektów open
source dla firmy Meta (ówcześnie Facebook Open Source). Joel Marcey, ich
<em>developer advocate</em>,
<a href="https://docusaurus.io/blog/2017/12/14/introducing-docusaurus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">napisał w 2017</a>,
że Docusaurus powstał po to, aby:</p>
<ol>
<li>Skupić się na pisaniu dobrej dokumentacji zamiast martwić się o
infrastrukturę strony.</li>
<li>Dać stronom dokumentacyjnym najważniejsze funkcjonalności, czyli
wersjonowanie, wyszukiwanie i blogowanie.</li>
<li>Dzielić się ze społecznością open source najnowszymi funkcjonalnościami i bug
fixami w przystepny sposób. Osiągnęli to publikując Docusaurusa jako
biblioteki NPMowe.</li>
<li>Żeby stronki o ich projektach open source miały wspólny wygląd i
funkcjonalność.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ta ostatni cecha przysłużyła się szerszej społeczności i stała się swego rodzaju
standardem w pewnych kręgach.</p>
<p>Docusaurus ma typowe cechy strony z dokumentacją:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strona domowa z linkami do najważniejszych miejsc.</li>
<li>Podstronki z dokumentacją i nawigacją po lewej, która pozwala się po nich
swobodnie poruszać.</li>
<li>Pole wyszukiwania w prawym górnym rogu.</li>
<li>Sekcja "blog".</li>
<li>Strona z wersjami i linkami do release note'ów.</li>
<li>Numer wersji w górnym pasku strony i możliwość przełączania się między
wersjami.</li>
<li>Możliwość przełączania się między językami.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dodatkowo, na stronach z dokumentacją można używać wszelkich dobrodziejstw
Markdowna. Oprócz typowych list, tabel, linków i obrazków, możesz znaleźć takie
rzeczy jak bloki kodu, wyróżnione notki, czy sekcje zwijane. Zobacz nasze
przykłady poniżej.</p>
<p>Bloki kodu (<em>code blocks</em>) z pokolorowanymi literkami i przyciskiem do
kopiowania. Można je też wzbogacić o działający podgląd, jeżeli próbka kodu jest
na przykład napisana w Reakcie. Co więcej, można pozwolić użytkownikowi edytować
ten podgląd, tak jak poniżej.</p>

<p>Docusaurus pozwala na stworzenie
<a href="https://docusaurus.io/docs/versioning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strony, która zawiera w sobie wiele wersji</a>.
To dobre podejście dla małych, zamkniętych projektów, które pozwala
użytkownikowi na wgląd w dowolną wersję w zależności od potrzeb. Mechanizm
wersjonowania jest dosyć prosty w obsłudze i jest w pełni opcjonalny. Cała
strona może być skonstruowana tak, że reprezentuje tylko jedną najnowszą wersję.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="wyszukiwanie">Wyszukiwanie<a href="https://techwriter.pl/docusaurus-zielony-przyjaciel#wyszukiwanie" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Wyszukiwanie" title="Bezpośredni link do Wyszukiwanie">​</a></h2>
<p>Docusaurus pozwala na prostą integrację z serwisem
<a href="https://www.algolia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Algolia</a>. To dobra opcja, jeżeli nasza strona jest
powszechnie dostępna w Internecie, bo Algolia wymaga otwartego dostępu, żeby
zindeksować stronę. Jeżeli to nie pasuje do naszej sytuacji, możemy skorzystać z

swój własny mechanizm wyszukiwania.</p>

<p>Docusaurus posiada opcję wielokrotnego użycia tego samego fragmentu za pomocą
<a href="https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/react#importing-markdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">importów w pliku Markdown</a>.
Co więcej, takie fragmenty mogą mieć parametry, dzięki czemu stają się jeszcze
bardziej uniwersalne. Na przykład:</p>
<div class="language-markdown codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockTitle_Ktv7">_fruit.mdx</div><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-markdown codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">Mój ulubiony owoc to {props.fruit}!</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Kopiuj do schowka" title="Kopiuj" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>Używamy go w taki sposób:</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tłumaczenie">Tłumaczenie<a href="https://techwriter.pl/docusaurus-zielony-przyjaciel#t%C5%82umaczenie" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Tłumaczenie" title="Bezpośredni link do Tłumaczenie">​</a></h2>
<p>Docusaurus ma
<a href="https://docusaurus.io/docs/i18n/introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wbudowany kompletny mechanizm</a>,
który pozwala przetłumaczyć większość stron w większości przypadków. Jedyny
wyjątek stanowi skomplikowane użycie plików MDX, które jeszcze nie jest do końca
proste do przetłumaczenia. Ale są sposoby, żeby to obejść.</p>
<p>Podstawą mechanizmu tłumaczenia są dwa aspekty:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pliki MDX są tłumaczone jak pliki Markdown. Większość agencji tłumaczeniowych
i narzędzi do tłumaczeń powinna sobie z tym poradzić.</li>
<li>Tłumaczenie customowych stron JSX/TSX i innego kodu możemy osiągnąć używając
wbudowanych komend, które ekstrahują tekst do plików JSON.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="blogowanie">Blogowanie<a href="https://techwriter.pl/docusaurus-zielony-przyjaciel#blogowanie" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Blogowanie" title="Bezpośredni link do Blogowanie">​</a></h2>
<p>Jeżeli chcecie publikować nowości o Waszym projekcie, Docusaurus proponuje
zrobić to przez moduł do blogowania. Każdy post na blogu jest plikiem MDX i
zachowuje się bardzo podobnie do strony z docsami, ale dodatkowo ma datę.
Posiada też tagi, które pozwalają wyświetlić listę podobnych wpisów.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="jsx-react-i-nodejs">JSX, React i Node.js<a href="https://techwriter.pl/docusaurus-zielony-przyjaciel#jsx-react-i-nodejs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do JSX, React i Node.js" title="Bezpośredni link do JSX, React i Node.js">​</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://mdxjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Format MDX</a> używany w Docusaurusie pozwala na używanie
komponentów JSX lub TSX (TypeScript), czyli elementów strony napisanych w
Reakcie. Jeżeli potrafisz programować, lub znasz kogoś kto potrafi, to otwiera
całą masę możliwości:</p>
<ul>
<li>Konfigurowalne formularze</li>
<li>Tabele, listy, lub sekcje, których treść pochodzi ze źródła danych</li>
<li>Strony generowanie w czasie budowania, na przykład zawierające listy błędów
lub parametrów</li>
<li>Interaktywne próbki kodu z plików, które mogą być testowane pod kątem
poprawności</li>
<li>Pięknie wystylizowanie karty, galerie, karuzele i tym podobne.</li>
</ul>
<p>Docusaurus jest budowany za pomocą <a href="https://nodejs.org/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Node.js</a>. To oznacza,
że w momencie budowania mamy pełną władzę nad tym skąd pochodzi treść co daje
nam sporo opcji automatyzacji. Możemy wszystko napisać ręcznie, ale możemy też
niektóre lub wszystkie strony <code>wygenerować</code>. Na przykład możemy pobrać dane z
bazy i wygenerować z nich tabele, albo zebrać wpisy na bloga z CMSa, lub release
notes z Jiry. Dla majsterkowicza z odrobiną zapału wszystko jest możliwe.</p>

<p>W momencie publikacji artykułu, Docusaurus jest darmowy i można go wykorzystywać
dowolnie, ale zapoznajcie się z warunkami licencji zanim skoczycie na głęboką
wodę. Ten wpis na blogu nie stanowi porady prawnej, oferty handlowej, ani nie
może byc użyty jako kupon zniżkowy w sklepie z rowerami.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hostowanie">Hostowanie<a href="https://techwriter.pl/docusaurus-zielony-przyjaciel#hostowanie" class="hash-link" aria-label="Bezpośredni link do Hostowanie" title="Bezpośredni link do Hostowanie">​</a></h2>
<p>Magia stron statycznych polega na tym, że można je hostować praktycznie
wszędzie! Co to oznacza? Poradzi sobie z nimi dowolny serwer o architekturze
podobnej do Apache Web Server, dowolny CDN, czy serwis taki jak Amazon S3.
Docusaurus generuje pliki HTML, CSS i Javascript czyli absolutny standard.</p>
<p>Dobrą opcją na hostowanie Docusaurusa są
<a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Pages</a>, ale możecie skorzystać z bardzo wielu
innych, o czym przeczytacie na stronie
<a href="https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Deployment"</a>.</p>

<p>Wszystko jest opisane <a href="https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tutaj</a>. Ale z
grubsza wygląda to tak:</p>
<ol>
<li>Zainstaluj Node.js (np. przez NVM).</li>
<li>Zainstaluj Docusaurusa, żeby stworzyć lokalny folder projektu.</li>
<li>Napisz docsy w Markdownie.</li>
<li>Wypchnij zmiany do systemu kontroli wersji.</li>
<li>Opublikuj.</li>
<li>Czerp korzyści i zyskaj niezależność finansową.</li>
</ol>
<p>A Wy korzystaliście już z Docusaurusa? Jeśli tak, dajcie nam znać w komentarzach
co sądzicie o tym narzędziu.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Organizatorom zależy, by spotkania były istotne i przybliżały tematy, które są
dla Was interesujące. Możecie zgłosić temat, a my dołożymy wszelkich starań, aby
znaleźć prelegentów, którzy będą mogli o nim porozmawiać. Możecie także sami
zostać prelegentami na jednym z naszych spotkań.</p>
<p>Osoby zainteresowane mogą dołączyć do MeetContent na
<a href="https://meetcontent.slack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slacku</a>, aby być na bieżąco z nadchodzącymi
wydarzeniami i proponować nowe tematy.</p>
